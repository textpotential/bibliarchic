* I wonder if the reading plans of YouVersion are actually a decreased surface area in comparison to the high surface area of participation in a roll, where user has to roll the book to locate the pertinent passage for a particular reading. If an interface simply tweets or emails a user with a passage, it seems that this could actually be a lack of surface area on the participation end, even if the several channels of interaction with the text could be an increase of surface area. It is critical that surface area increase involvement, not just consumption of content and perhaps this is the difference here?

In the previous chapter, we looked at the possibility of proximity in book interfaces of bible. For our purposes, I limited the concept of book to a reading and writing technology that involved combining pages of material together in a sequence to create a discrete interface for a specific text or collection of texts. Even if these book interfaces have dominated the cultural imagination of bible throughout most of its history, bible has always exceeded the book through aural/oral interfaces such as storytelling and preaching as well as artistic interfaces like music and art. Emerging technologies such as manuscript digitization, extensible markup language (XML), and application programming interfaces (API) continue to push bible as interface beyond the book. Though these emerging interfaces are changing user relationships with bible through new affordances and expansions of scale in familiar affordances, our characteristics of a proximate interface-- high surface area, collaborative capacities, and anarchic tendencies-- can provide a means of translating the values of proximity from our cherished interface of the book into technological realms we can't yet imagine. If bible as interface is more than simply the consumption of the content in a container, then we need to continue attending to the affordances made possible in the relationships of bible and user in emerging interfaces. 

In this chapter, I will look closely at three interfaces of bible that push beyond the book without eradicating it in the use of internet technologies to afford relationships of bible and user. First, the Codex Sinaiticus Project provides a direct material media translation of the codex interface we explored in the previous chapter into a web interface. Second, the Society of Biblical Literature Greek New Testament offers an example of a critical edition of bible designed to reach beyond the limits of print. Third, we will look at the entanglement of interfaces involved in the Digital Bible Library project, which looks to provide the definitive global repository for bible as data. In each of these interfaces, I will look for the possibility of proximity in the consistent tension of a nearness that demands user participation in the interface and a distance that resists mastery and closure. 

## Consolidating a Legacy: The Codex Sinaiticus Project ##

As I have mentioned before in relationship to the materiality of interfaces and in our detailed look at Codex Sinaiticus in the previous chapter, one of the earliest and most comprehensive attempts to bring an ancient bible interface into a new scale of user relationships through digitization and the internet was the Codex Sinaiticus Project.^[To learn more about the project and to participate in the interface, go to http://www.codexsinaiticus.org. To read more about this great manuscript and the process undertaken to make this digitization project possible, see the chapter on "The Virtual Codex Sinaiticus" in David Parker's popular level book on the history of this manuscript, *Codex Sinaiticus: The Story of the World's Oldest Bible*, 167-184. He even discusses the use of XML and provides a sample of the transcription. For a more detailed account of the project, see the collection of essays in the more recent *TITLE*...] The collaborative nature of this project is evident immediately when you encounter the website. The rare four columns per page of the Sinaiticus manuscript are matched by the four institutional partners and the corresponding four interface languages available on the site. This kind of international collaboration was necessary given the goal of the project to restitch together the pieces of Codex Sinaiticus that are still extant into a single interface again. Over the years, the remains of the codex have been spread across the British Library, the library of the University of Leipzig, the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg, and Saint Catherine's Monastery.^[One of the principles of the project as agreed to by all parties was to reconstruct a modern history of the manuscript upon which all partners could agree and to publish this history along with access to the documents themselves. See http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/codex/history.aspx and the chapter in TITLE.] Before we even begin talking about the details of the emerging technologies that have shaped these new bible interfaces in the Codex Sinaiticus Project, we can see here an expansion of the codex's affordance of collectability at work in the gathering together of these disparate parts of the manuscript into a single interface through digitization and web delivery. In its time, Sinaiticus itself was a marvel in its capacity for collecting together texts into one interface and the Codex Sinaiticus Project has continued this legacy in new media forms by working with political and spatial limits to bring four collections at four different institutions together into one bible interface. 

The Codex Sinaiticus Project imagined itself as a multiple interface project from the beginning, with the driving values of conservation and dissemination of this historical manuscript. The conservation efforts of the project included the preparation and care of the manuscript leaves in each location as well as the digitization of each page of the manuscript for use in the multiple aspects of study and dissemination at work in the project. Given the values of consolidation at work in the Codex Sinaiticus Project, I find the language of access to be a better fit than dissemination in describing the construction of interfaces for the project. I admire the project team's openness to both traditional and emerging technologies as means of providing access to the manuscript. Along with the web interface we will explore closely, the project has produced a traditional print facsimile of the manuscript, a conference, an interactive library and museum exhibition, a popular level book discussing the history of the manuscript and the project itself, and an academic collection of essays from the conference analyzing interesting findings made available by the new interfaces of the project and detailing the technical procedures operative in developing the interfaces.^[Provide bibliography for all of these... ] This proliferation of interfaces for the project participates in some of the high surface area and collaborative capacities we found in the ancient codex itself. 

I can sympathize with the enthusiasm of the hyperbolic marketing of the project with language such as "Experience the oldest bible" as the tagline on the main home page of the website and statements like "...the Project gives everyone the opportunity to connect directly with this famous manuscript."^[See the subtitle for the website and the home page blurb under "The Codex Sinaiticus Project" heading for these two examples.] It is important to remember that Codex Sinaiticus is only the oldest extant manuscript of what most consider to be the whole New Testament, not the oldest bible interface at all. The project has done wonderful cutting edge work to make Codex Sinaiticus accessible to a public audience without necessitating travel to four different locations around the world. Yet, the web interface of Codex Sinaiticus is not a simple reproduction of the parchment codex in digital form. The web interface of Codex Sinaiticus is a *different* bible interface built upon the data of the manuscript, which has involved media translations at several levels. So, though this wonderful web interface provided by the Codex Sinaiticus Project definitely increases the opportunity for people to "connect with this famous manuscript," this interface has different affordances than turning the parchment pages of a fragment of the codex in the rare book reading room at the British Library. Just like the physical materialities of the giant book provide possibilities and limits for how a user might relate to this bible, so too the digital materialities of the Codex Sinaiticus Project web interface create a particular set of possible relationships of user with bible. One quick example of these material differences. If I were to participate in the codex interface of Codex Sinaiticus at Saint Catherine's Monastery Library, as a user, I would experience the binding of the codex as one of the material characteristics shaping the space of that interface. After all, the binding at one edge of the quires of the codex is one of the crowning aspects of book as we know it. In the web interface of Codex Sinaiticus, the images of the leaves show the marks of binding, but there is no user experience of the boundedness of the quires, except for the small glimpses of the folded pages seen in the margins of the photographs. Thus, in this web interface, we experience a kind of rebinding of the codex by bringing all of the leaves of Sinaiticus together in one interface again, yet the user contact with binding is minimized in the interface. These material differences impact user relationship with bible, so it is important to attend to the differences at work in these new interfaces of bible. 

As an example of bible interface beyond book, I will look closely at the web interface created by the Codex Sinaiticus Project to see how it might afford proximity through the performance of high surface area, collaborative capacities and anarchic tendencies. Along the way, you will find mention of the other interfaces of the Codex Sinaiticus project, but my focus will be on how the website crafts possible relationships between user and bible in interface. I am deeply indebted to the Codex Sinaiticus Project for providing access to a treasure that has shaped my own scholarly work in significant ways and I cherish the opportunity to reflect on the challenges and possibilities of the materialities of this particular digital bible interface. At its simplest, the web interface of the Codex Sinaiticus Project is basically a material media translation and expansion of a print facsimile edition of an ancient manuscript into the medium of the web. Like a facsimile, this web bible interface affords broader access to the manuscript without increasing the numbers of hands touching the fragile ancient material. Often, in print facsimiles, the photography constrains what can be seen of the characteristics of the artifact, so physical descriptions and transcriptions may accompany the photographs to help users have more data to work with in the interface. The web Sinaiticus interface consists of four main parts, the digital images of the manuscript, a physical description of each page, a transcription, and a translation where available. Using the advantages of internet technologies, the web Sinaiticus interface has linked the images to the transcription in a detailed fashion, so a user can choose a discrete location either in the transcription or the image of the page and the interface will highlight that same location in the other. These connected layers are one of the distinct advantages of the 

Though this chapter is about interfaces beyond book, The Codex Sinaiticus Project is barely beyond book as an interface. In so many ways, the project continues to perform codex in a web platform. It is still primarily oriented around the codex page, with linear and non-linear navigation affordances much like the Kindle bible interface. The extant leaves of the codex are actually better bound together in this web interface than they are in the four sets of remains spread around the world. Even the different layers of the web interface, the image, the transcription, and the translation, are bound together in this interface by the synchronous focus when a user clicks on any one of the layers. 

### Digitization as Translation ###
At the core of both the conservation and access aims of the project was the digitization of the pages of the massive codex. It is important to note here that the conservation efforts operated at more than one material level. First, the physical aspects of the codex such as the parchment and the binding were assessed, repaired, fortified, and cared for to prolong the life of this magnificent historical bible interface for users. Second,
