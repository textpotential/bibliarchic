Introduce my struggle with the archic as located specifically in a particularly Christian notion of bible as interface that led toward archic dispositions.
Again, interface is about a relationship between user and paltform, not simply the material determinisms of a given technological set.
So, I am not suggesting that the predominance of codex and of print afforded archic dispositions on their own, rather the uses of the codex as interface toward canonization and construction of a critical scholarly edition demonstrate the archic dispositions.
After demonstrating these archic bible interfaces, I will then 

With the help of Johanna Drucker's call to humanities scholars to attend to interface design, we have seen that book as interface provokes probabilistic production in a reading event.
Even as we have moved beyond any notion of interface as static surface or as container for content, we still have the imperative to design and analyze interfaces to encourage a set of dispositions that would support the provocation of probabilistic production in reading practice.
Drucker offers several suggestions in this direction at the end of her piece on the Humanities and Interface Theory (Drucker 2011, ??).
In this chapter I will advocate for one particular disposition for us to consider in our design of bible as interface.
This disposition is anarchy, reading practices not governed by an original text or singular unifying principle.


How would an interface encourage such a disposition toward anarchy? Interfaces on their own, as with all technologies, do not propagate dispositions or values.
Technologies do not define or determine us.
Rather, it is our *relationship with* interfaces that *afford* the encouragement of dispositions.
In no way do I mean to suggest that interfaces or other technologies are neutral with respect to values.^[A note here about my dissatisfaction with Richard Cohen's Levinasian analysis of the ethics of new media in conversation with Introna and Turkle.] I am simply reiterating Drucker's point that interface is a zone of encounter, where meaning is made through the indeterminate yet constrained entanglement of physical space and user participation.
Affordances offer a way of talking about our relationships with and participation in the physical spaces of interface.

The transcripts of the 197? radio conversations between Nemo and Levinas near the end of his writing career were my introduction to the ideas, thought, and methodology of Levinas and as I continue to encounter more of his work, I come back to these interviews and hear them with deeper resonance and richness each time (Cohen and Levinas, EI).
In the first question of the first interview transcribed in *Ethics and Infinity*, which is titled 'Bible and Philosophy,' Levinas articulates the deep value of reading and the special role of bible in his approach to philosophy, saying,

> I think that in the great fear of bookishness, one underestimates the "ontological" reference of the human to the book that one takes for a source of information, or for a "tool" of learning, a *textbook*, even though it is a *modality* of our being...In this sense the Bible would be for me the book par excellence (Cohen translating Levinas, *Ethics and Infinity*, 3-4).

I read here a philosophically veiled articulation of the argument we have been exploring all along, the difference between book as container and book as interface.
Levinas suggests that our relationship with books, "bookishness," is far more than simply a content delivery and consumption mechanism and even exceeds the pursuit of knowledge.
These two "ontological" concepts of book, consumption of content and the pursuit of knowledge, he caricatures with the image of a textbook, a container par excellence.
This view of book as container sounds eerily similar to the dangerous essence of technology that Heidegger cautions against in QCT, which makes all things into a store of information.^[See Chapter 2.] Alternatively, Levinas suggests that our relationship with books, which he calls reading and I call use, is not like a textbook, but instead is "a modality of our being," with Bible as "the book par excellence." The historic relationship Jews have had with the Bible demonstrates for Levinas this modality of being in reading that is not reducible to the consumption of content.
He says, 

> The sentiment that the Bible is the Book of books wherein the first things are said, those that *became* said so that human life has a meaning, and are said in a form which opens to commentators the same dimension of profundity, was not some simple substitution of a literary judgment onto the consciousness of the "sacred." It is that extraordinary presence of its characters, that ethical plenitude and its mysterious possibilities of exegesis which originally signified transcendence for me.
And no less (Cohen translating Levinas, *EI*, 23).

A close read of this response could take us on a journey through much of Levinas's philosophical ideas, but we will focus on just a few pieces that illustrate bible as a book that is something exceeding a container of content.
Similar to what we saw with his reflections on Paul Celan's poetry as a language of and for proximity, Levinas offers us a concept of bible that signals the encounter with the face (a synonym for the notion of proximity we built in the last chapter).
Describing the nature of encounter with the Bible, Levinas says, “For us, the world of the Bible is a world not of figures, but of faces.”^[Emmanuel Levinas, *Difficult Freedom: Essays on Judaism* (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), 140.] In what way does encounter with the Bible constitute encounter with faces? Is this a reference to the faces of the many people in the stories of the Bible or even the faces of those who have read and passed on the traditions surrounding the Bible? The Bible is face even before the stories and their long tradition of interpretation are known.
Before becoming a document, regardless of the specific content within, bible as book demands a reading process that performs proximity.^[Emmanuel Levinas, “On the Jewish Reading of Scriptures,” in Levinas and Biblical Studies, eds.
Tamara Cohn Eskanazi, Gary A.
Philips and David Jobling (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2003), 27.] The overflow of potential meaning in the smallest lexical units of the biblical texts defies containment just as proximity maintains a relationship that increases both nearness (responsibility) and distance (otherness).

The "ethical plenitude" and "extraordinary presence" Levinas attributes to the bible can be taken as synonyms for the nearness and distance of proximity, respectively.
Ethical plenitude refers not to an abundantly recurring theme of ethics in the content of the biblical writings, but to a relationship of approach in reading that inexhaustibly demands a response.
This ethics is a process of reading that opens to "mysterious possibilities of exegesis" not a prescriptive content to be consumed.
The extraordinary presence of the biblical characters is not a celebration of the great cloud of witnesses in the biblical stories.
Rather, these characters are the very letters of the text before they are assembled into words and phrases.
These characters appear ("presence") in ways that are beyond the ordinary, such that they remain at a distance, irreducible to the semiotic performance of their combinatorial effects.
Proximately, the characters of the bible provide a relationship in reading that can be characterized by contact without grasp, a reading that opens to "mysterious possibilities of exegesis."^[In his reflections on revelation in the Jewish tradition, Levinas, *Beyond the Verse*, 132, suggests, "It is by going back to the Hebrew text from the translations, vulnerable as they may be, that the strange or mysterious ambiguity or polysemy authorized by the Hebrew syntax is revealed: words coexist rather than immediately being co-ordinated or subordinated with and to one another, contrary to what is predominant in the languages that are said to be developed or functional.
This coexistence of words before and irreducible to their coordination is the extraordinary presence of the characters of the bible.] 

These reflections from Levinas on the role of bible as book beyond and before the content of the stories it contains have played an important role in developing my approach to bible as a proximate interface, a space of encounter that demands a response (near) and resists mastery (distant).
Our current media landscape has brought the concept of interface to the fore and given us a chance to reflect on the usefulness of interface as a way to think about bible.
Yet, bible has been an interface for its entire history.
A look at the relationship of users with bible throughout history will demonstrate that considering bible as interface is not a break with tradition, but a kind of translation of it.
As we noted in chapter one, interface does not simply indicate a tool used to achieve a particular aim.
Interface describes a relationship of a user with a book that exceeds the simple delivery of content for consumption.
Let us look at some examples of this relationship throughout the media lives of bible.



It is not bible as a recipe book for determinate beliefs that signaled transcendence, rather the possibilities found in its infinite process of reading as meaning making.
This process of reading as meaning, interpretation, Levinas suggests bible and philosophy may have in common.

In another nod to the fragmentary nature of the digital, the method used by the web interface of Codex Sinaiticus to afford user interaction with the digital images involves putting together several small selections of a page image in a grid.
Instead of simply loading the entire page image  

higher surface area because one page at time instead of two open across binding and two different lighting images.
The ability to navigate by book, chapter, verse offers slightly more surface area via more granular navigation.
Interestingly though, the zoom and navigation afforded on the website is not significantly different than what would be possible with codex interface.


If bible as interface is irreducible to the consumption of the content in a container, then we need to continue attending to the affordances made possible in the relationships of bible and user in emerging interfaces.
Given the values of consolidation at work in the Codex Sinaiticus Project, I find the language of access to be a better fit than dissemination in describing the construction of interfaces for the project.

The hyperbolic marketing of the project uses language such as "Experience the oldest bible" as the tagline on the main home page of the website and statements like "The Project gives everyone the opportunity to connect directly with this famous manuscript."[^3] Yet, Codex Sinaiticus is only the oldest extant manuscript of what most consider to be the whole New Testament, not the oldest bible interface at all.
[^3]: See the subtitle for the website and the home page blurb under "The Codex Sinaiticus Project" heading at http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/ for these two examples.

Along the way, you will find mention of the other interfaces of the Codex Sinaiticus project, but my focus will be on how the website crafts possible relationships between user and bible in interface.
