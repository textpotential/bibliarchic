Yet, it is important to have a detailed sense of the assumptions built into the data shaping the interfaces we will discuss next, even if DBL has afforded rather high collaborative capacities in its bible interface.


DBL does not look at all like a bible, it has no covers and nothing resembling pages, even at the XML level.^[Some REST APIs like that used by DBL do have a structure of pagination that returns only a certain number of data elements per request.] The content of what is typically considered bible is in DBL, in fact in over a thousand different languages including audio and text for many of these languages.
Yet, given our discussion of interface as irreducible to content, the fact that DBL contains the texts usually held between the covers of a bound codex called bible is not enough to deem it bible.
Does this bible interface afford proximity? Can we require this of bible interfaces? If so, are there bibles as we have known them that do not meet this requirement? It is critical to keep in mind the   

* I wonder if the reading plans of YouVersion are actually a decreased surface area in comparison to the high surface area of participation in a roll, where user has to roll the book to locate the pertinent passage for a particular reading.
If an interface simply tweets or emails a user with a passage, it seems that this could actually be a lack of surface area on the participation end, even if the several channels of interaction with the text could be an increase of surface area.
It is critical that surface area increase involvement, not just consumption of content and perhaps this is the difference here?

Perhaps the place to begin with a bible interface like the Bible App, which is used predominantly on mobile devices, is a consideration of the high surface area promoted by the sheer number of users of this interface.
The number of users of a roll or codex bible interface are quite limited given geographical, social, and literacy limitations.
A Kindle bible interface is limited by the finances of purchasing the Kindle book and having a device that can read Kindle books.
The Codex Sinaiticus Project speaks often of its one million visitors, which is a massive expansion of accessibility in terms of a single bible interface.
DBL as an interface only has a handful of library card holders, so the number of users is kept to a minimum.

Nearly three hundred million devices using this one bible interface is a grand scale of high surface area.

Though the layers of interface in the mobile internet world are myriad, this proliferation is not a new phenomenon for bible.
With its significant borrowing from, interpretation of and building on the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Testament can be considered a bible interface constructed from an earlier bible interface.
Bishop Karen Oliveto offering a sermon in a chapel service is a bible interface built upon the interface of the biblical text and the liturgical sung response in said service offers another layer of interface.
This ongoing interface of interfaces has been a part of the life of bible since long before the advent of XML or APIs and this continuity is important as we consider bible as interface in our current emerging media landscape.

On a closer look at the workflow and data structures of DBL, it is clear that the foundational unit for the datastore is the textual content of a particular translation, which is no surprise given the translation context from which this whole project arose.
The data stored in DBL comes in two forms, an archive bundle and a release bundle.
The archive bundle is simply a highly redundant backup of the project files used to produce a given bible text so that the project can be reconstituted if lost.

## Bible Goes Mobile ##

One of the main users of the DBL bible interface is the incredibly popular bible interface produced by Life.Church called YouVersion.[^22] It's utter dominance in the mobile bible market has allowed the app to take on the more generic name of simply "The Bible App."[^23] In the app store on Apple's iOS, the name of the app is simply "Bible" and their own language in the description of the app simply refers to it as The Bible App.[^24] Although this bible interface most definitely pushes far beyond the book in many ways, the icon for The Bible App is a cartoon representation of a leather bound print codex with a red silk bookmark and the title "Holy Bible" in gold letters on the cover.[^25] The iconicity of bible as book still has a role to play even in these emerging interfaces that seem to crack its binding.[^26] Though the Bible App works in a web browser and on any internet capable mobile device on the market today, I will focus on the operation of the Bible App on an iPhone 7 running iOS 10.3.
As I have mentioned before, each different device interface offers different affordances in concert with the Bible App interface, yet the basic insights about the possibility for high surface area, collaboration, and anarchy in interface would apply to all of the possible devices.

## Our Daily Bread ##

At the time of this writing, the Bible App offers a user just over 1500 bible versions in over 1000 different languages and some of these versions include both audio and text.
Much like the codex bible was as much a library as a book, collecting together different writings from different contexts together in one interface, the Bible App too functions as a library of bible content in a consolidated interface.[^27] The home page of the app presents a user with an array of messages signaling things that can be done with the app or ways to get involved in the communities who use the app, such as downloading bible versions for offline use or participating in reading plans.
One of the predominant structures found in the Bible App interface is the Verse of the Day functionality, which also appears on the home page when users access the app.
Every day, a verse is selected and presented in text and in text over image form and offered to users across the platform.[^28] The text of the bible is broken into verse size bits and offered as a different surface each day of the year.
These daily bits are also gathered together in an aggregated Verse of the Day view in the interface to provide a calendrical navigation through the bible in image and text.
By breaking the text into verse sized bits, delivering them to a user out of context, and creating an ongoing emerging aggregation of these bits that need not reflect the organization of any original text, the Verse of the Day function in the Bible App demonstrates affordances of both high surface area and anarchy.
The collaborative affordances of the Bible App interface are also on display in the Verse of the Day functionality, by allowing a user to attach their own image to the verse of the day and easily share this out through social media channels.
In the settings associated with the Verse of the Day, a user can elect to have the text and/or image verse of the day sent to their email or sent to the screen notifications of their mobile device (push notifications).
Though these settings offer efficient ways for users to contact the content provided by the Bible App interface, they could have an effect of disincentivizing user participation in the interface and thus lowering the surface are and collaborative affordances of the Bible App.
Surface area as an affordance increases user involvement, it does not simply enable more efficient consumption of content.

## Reading as Participation ##

Moving from left to right along the global navigation of the Bible App interface, the next user option after Home is "Read."[^29] The primary reading interface does not require an account and offers a simple and accessible set of features for a user.
The textual area shows one chapter of scrollable text at a time including in-line verse numbers and copyright information at the bottom of each chapter.
A user can enable or disable options to show red letters, cross references, and footnotes when available in the text.[^30] Much like we saw in the Kindle bible interface, additional collaborative affordances allow user construction of the space including choice of font size, font type, and a light or dark background.
Unlike the Kindle bible interface, user selection of a larger font in the Bible App does not change the amount of text displayed on a single page, if we consider a page the scrollable text available at one time without having to navigate using the next page or previous page icons.
A Kindle user, by choosing a font size, actually determines the size of a page, requiring more page turns for larger fonts and vice versa.
In the Bible App, font size does impact how much text is on the viewable screen at a time and can increase or decrease the amount a user needs to scroll to get through the text.
Yet, structurally, in the Bible App, chapter defines the "page," not amount of text, and page numbers are not present anywhere within the interface.
In this way, the Bible App has made a decisive move beyond the book as an interface, no longer allowing the page to govern its material structure.

The basic navigation of the Bible App interface reinforces this chapter based structure.
There are simple forward and backward arrow icons at the bottom of the screen that allow the user to easily move linearly through the bible chapter by chapter.
At the top of the reader view, there are two selection menus that display the current book, chapter and version being displayed.
Clicking on the chapter selector menu allows a user to browse through the content of this bible version and choose a book and chapter to display.
The books in this selection list can by ordered by "traditional" canonical order, as they typically appear in print bibles, or alphabetically.
Changing bible versions is made simple by the version selector, which allows for filtering the list by language and offers a search function to locate a particular version by name or abbreviation.
Finally, the basic reading interface of the Bible App also offers search as a navigational option.
This exponential expansion of non-linear access to text affords a user an incredible amount of agency in participating in the interface.
A search for keywords, names, references, etc.
will return an aggregated list of verses from throughout the text that have some mention of or relationship to the search terms.
Clicking on any one of the verses returned will show that single verse alone in the interface, with an option to see the full chapter from which the verse comes.[^31] By default, these search results are returned in order of relevance, but a user can elect to have them listed in the order in which they appear in a print edition of the text, which they label as "traditional." Either sort order of a search result has the potential to bring pieces of the bible text near to one another that usually exist at a great distance.
For example, I just ran a search on the word "death" and the first two verses returned by relevance were 2 Kings 1:1 and 1 Corinthians 15:55.
These verses have no explicit connection within the typical structuring of the text, but the interests of the user articulated in the search function of the interface have constructed an emergent relationship.
This collaborative affordance of the Bible App that allows the user to construct new relationships between text in the interface leverages the nearness of the many points of contact with the bible and reinforces the distance of an inability to master the interface, since new combinations can be crafted all the time.

The collaborative affordances of the Bible App interface are most prevalent in the ways in which a user can interact with the text of bible versions in the interface.
By simply tapping on a verse in the text, the verse is underlined to identify that it is the focus and a user is presented with anew set of menu options at the bottom of the screen.
A user can select a single verse or many verses at the same time, with a second tap on a verse deselecting it.
A user can not select a smaller unit of text than an entire verse, which is much lower surface area than a Kindle bible or the Codex Sinaiticus web bible interface, which both allow selection at the word level.
Given that the source of the bible versions in the Bible App is the DBL bible interface, which encoded verse as the smallest unit of text in the XML of the release bundle, it is not a surprise to see verse as the smallest unit in the Bible App.
Here we see the digital materiality of one interface shaping the material possibilities of another, such that a user can not select a single word in a verse to engage in the Bible App interface.
The menu that appears when selecting a verse or group of verses allows a user to highlight the selection, share the selection with any channel available in the iOS sharing system, associate an image with the selection, compare the selection with other bible versions, bookmark the selection, add a note to the selection, copy the text of the selection, and see a list of related items attached to this selection by users from the Bible App community.

The two most interesting collaborative affordances in this verse selection menu are the "compare" and the "related" features.
The compare feature allows the user to look at the selected verse or verses in different versions together on the screen.
Using the version selector, I can pick any of the 1500 versions to include in the comparison.
There are 50 English language versions alone that could be read side by side to see the variability of translation and the semantic potential of a given verse just in a single language, let alone through comparison with other language systems.
This compare feature gives the user another way in the Bible App to construct the interface by choosing texts that are displayed together in an organization scheme decided upon by the user.
More importantly, the ability to see a verse in several different versions, some of which a user may not even be able to read fully, challenges the notion of a single text that governs all versions and can awaken the user to difference and ambiguity in the interface.
The anarchic affordance of this compare feature can resist attempts by a user to master the interface by not allowing reduction of bible to a singular governing version.
Instead, the compare feature and the ever growing versions available can interrupt any tendency toward mastery and open users up to the emerging polyvocality of the text.[^beal]

[^beal]: Already anticipating bible as interface in his connection of emerging digital technologies with the changing cultural conception of bible, Timothy Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, Kindle location 2030, points to polyvocality even within a single version of bible as an interruptive mechanism that resists reduction of bible to any simple consumptive use.
So, this affordance of anarchy in the search functionality of the Bible App is not a new phenomenon for bible, but more of an expansion of an affordance already latent in bible interfaces due to the composition of the collection.

In concert with the note facility, the "related" feature of the Bible App opens a text beyond simply the words contained in the version file loaded from DBL.
A user can add a note to a verse and mark this note private, for friends only, or public.
If a note is marked public, then any other user can select the same verse and choose the related menu item and see this note.
On an iPhone 7, this list of related notes loads in a new screen so the text of the selected verse isn't visible anymore.
Instead, the user is presented with a reverse chronological, most recent first, list of notes added to this particular verse by users all over the world.
This list of notes on a given verse gives a user a window into the larger community of users engaging in the interface, much like we saw in the popular highlights feature of the Kindle bible.
There is not a reply or conversation mechanism in this part of the Bible App interface to facilitate in-line or ongoing dialog, but a user can request to "friend" another user and then contact them through the app.
This functionality of the Bible App enacts two layers of collaborative affordances.
First, it allows users to participate in shaping the interface with their own highlights and notes.
Second, this annotative and sharing feature provides the scaffolding for users to locate themselves within a reading community and has the potential to make connections between users.

There are many additional features offered by the Bible App that continue to push bible beyond book including that these features continue to evolve as the app matures.
The Verse of the Day and search features heighten the surface area of the interface by creating many points of encounter with the interface and resisting total mastery of all the interface contains.
The compare functionality provides a possibility for anarchy as different versions challenge a consolidation of the text of bible to any single expression.
The annotative capacities, particularly the "related" list of community notes on a verse expand the collaborative affordances of the Bible App interface by involving the user in constructing the space and encouraging connection with other users through sharing and friending.
Even if not always realized in use, the Bible App's affordances of high surface area, collaboration, and anarchy can problematize the tendency to focus on bible interfaces beyond the book as doomed to distraction.[^32]

[^25]: In her recent book on translation and bible, Sarah Ruden insightfully describes bible as book using an exact description of the icon used by the Bible App, writing, "To the eye, the book typically offers a pebbly black vinyl cover (like nothing on a book you'd yearn to open up and explore), gold–colored insert title ("The Holy Bible," which to a lot of people says, "I think I'm too holy for you to touch"), and a withered–looking ribbon bookmark attached at the spine (as if it would be a big problem to lose your place in the ordinary way, and stray from the prescribed devotional verses)." Sarah Ruden, *The Face of Water: A Translator on Beauty and Meaning in the Bible* (New York: Pantheon Books, 2017), xv-xvi.

[^26]: This bound print bible icon is what identifies this bible app among other apps on a user's mobile device and is the favicon (image that shows in the tab for the site) and centered at the top of bible.com.
The primary visual brand of the bible app is this bound print bible icon.

[^28]: At present, I am unable to find any information regarding the selection algorithm used for which verse is presented to users on which day.

[^29]: This global navigation menu is only available in portrait mode on a device the size of an iPhone 7.
When the phone is turned horizontally into landscape mode in the reader view of the Bible App, the global navigation goes away to make as much readable area on the screen as possible.

[^30]: The red letter and footnotes are set to on by default, while the cross references are turned off.
A decision to leave cross references off by default could decrease the surface area of an interface by eliding other points of contact related to the current verse in view.

[^31]: As is customary practice, the copyright information for the version used to display the verse is also included on the page.

[^32]: See Siker, *Liquid Scriptures*, 98, for an example of the anxiety around distraction with bibles on screen.
