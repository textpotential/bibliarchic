Yet, it is important to have a detailed sense of the assumptions built into the data shaping the interfaces we will discuss next, even if DBL has afforded rather high collaborative capacities in its bible interface.


DBL does not look at all like a bible, it has no covers and nothing resembling pages, even at the XML level.^[Some REST APIs like that used by DBL do have a structure of pagination that returns only a certain number of data elements per request.] The content of what is typically considered bible is in DBL, in fact in over a thousand different languages including audio and text for many of these languages.
Yet, given our discussion of interface as irreducible to content, the fact that DBL contains the texts usually held between the covers of a bound codex called bible is not enough to deem it bible.
Does this bible interface afford proximity? Can we require this of bible interfaces? If so, are there bibles as we have known them that do not meet this requirement? It is critical to keep in mind the   

* I wonder if the reading plans of YouVersion are actually a decreased surface area in comparison to the high surface area of participation in a roll, where user has to roll the book to locate the pertinent passage for a particular reading.
If an interface simply tweets or emails a user with a passage, it seems that this could actually be a lack of surface area on the participation end, even if the several channels of interaction with the text could be an increase of surface area.
It is critical that surface area increase involvement, not just consumption of content and perhaps this is the difference here?

Perhaps the place to begin with a bible interface like the Bible App, which is used predominantly on mobile devices, is a consideration of the high surface area promoted by the sheer number of users of this interface.
The number of users of a roll or codex bible interface are quite limited given geographical, social, and literacy limitations.
A Kindle bible interface is limited by the finances of purchasing the Kindle book and having a device that can read Kindle books.
The Codex Sinaiticus Project speaks often of its one million visitors, which is a massive expansion of accessibility in terms of a single bible interface.
DBL as an interface only has a handful of library card holders, so the number of users is kept to a minimum.

Nearly three hundred million devices using this one bible interface is a grand scale of high surface area.

Though the layers of interface in the mobile internet world are myriad, this proliferation is not a new phenomenon for bible.
With its significant borrowing from, interpretation of and building on the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Testament can be considered a bible interface constructed from an earlier bible interface.
Bishop Karen Oliveto offering a sermon in a chapel service is a bible interface built upon the interface of the biblical text and the liturgical sung response in said service offers another layer of interface.
This ongoing interface of interfaces has been a part of the life of bible since long before the advent of XML or APIs and this continuity is important as we consider bible as interface in our current emerging media landscape.

On a closer look at the workflow and data structures of DBL, it is clear that the foundational unit for the datastore is the textual content of a particular translation, which is no surprise given the translation context from which this whole project arose.
The data stored in DBL comes in two forms, an archive bundle and a release bundle.
The archive bundle is simply a highly redundant backup of the project files used to produce a given bible text so that the project can be reconstituted if lost.
