Looking at bible in terms of users and interfaces instead of simply books and readers offers us four primary advantages. First, thinking of bible as interface rather than book can unsettle the unquestioned binding of bible and codex, which coincides with the dominant cultural reduction of book to codex. By looking back at the bible roll as an interface and forward to kindle reader as an interface for bible, we can imagine better what constitutes bible for users beyond our current limited conception of book. Second, a focus on bible as interface highlights the material affordances operative in different user relationships with bible that extend beyond typical modes of reading, such as annotation and illumination in margins, organizational schemes, and use of bible as artifact. Third, exploring bible as interface can challenge us to conceptualize bible through its use rather than reducing definitions of bible to the content it contains. Fourth, tracing the history of bible as interface allows us to see the continuities and discontinuities involved in media transitions/translations. An awareness of the ongoing relationships between familiar and emerging interfaces can help curb some of the anxiety that inevitably arises with new technologies. With these advantages in mind, I will describe three examples of bible as interface, the roll bible, the codex bible and the kindle bible. Before we look at each example, we need to understand the concept of affordances as a way to describe the possible relationships between a user and an environment or technological platform .  

## Introducing Affordance ##

Affordances were first introduced in by James J. Gibson, a perceptual psychologist, in 1977 in an article titled "The Theory of Affordances" (Gibson 1977). Gibson expands on this theory in his 1979 book, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*, where he offers the definition "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??). An important aspect of Gibson's invention of affordances is their relational nature. An affordance is the relationship between the physical properties of a "surface" and an organism encountering that surface (Gibson 1979, ??). 

Taking Gibson's lead, I will offer an example using codex as a surface engaged or used by a reader.^[Gibson's example is the relationship between an animal and a terrestrial surface. See Gibson 1979, ??.] The physical properties of a codex include flexible pages bound together on one long side with a cover on the front and back. The pages have writing on them. This codex *affords* reading for the reader. More specifically, the codex affords non-linear access to text because of the physical properties of binding on one side and flexible pages instead of being rolled up in one long sheet from one end to the other as in a scroll. This is simply one example of the relationship between physical properties of space and the affordances offered in the relationship with a user.

The critical piece of Gibson's theory is the relational nature of affordances and the way affordances problematize the binary between subject and object (Gibson 1979, ??). An affordance is not simply a property of an object or of a subject. Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant. This sounds a good bit like an interface. Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibilities offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface. ^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that occurs between bible and user.

## Affordance and Interface ##

One limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavior capacities of an organism. In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance. Donald Norman brought Gibson's notion of affordances into the world of human-computer interface design and focused the concept on those actions "perceived" as possible or likely by a user of an interface by combining the operations of affordances, signifiers, and constraints (Norman 2013, 145). Rather than exploring any action made possible by the relationship between the physical properties of an interface and the capacities of a user, Norman focused more on the possible uses that would make sense to a user when encountering an interface.^[In the first chapter of the revised and expanded edition of *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman tells the story of his relationship with Gibson and their fundamental disagreements about the interpretive role of the brain in the relationship between agents and objects (Norman 2013, 12). Norman is clear about his indebtedness to Gibson and the important contribution Gibson made to helping designers pay more attention to the information offered by the physical world.] 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14). If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user. Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces. The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14). Understandably, Norman is focused on intuitive and useful interface design, with primarily the designer in mind, so introducing the property of a signifier to help designers talk about what they are adding to an interface to point to an affordance makes good sense. Yet, one of the reasons I will stay closer to the more generic notion of affordances as we discuss bible as interface is to distance our design and analysis of interfaces from the singular intent of the "appropriate" or "proper" use of an interface as determined by the designer. In Norman's definiton of signifer, we can see this emphasis on the proper at work. He says, "For me, the term *signifier* refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a user" (Norman 2013, 14). This signifer as indicator of "appropriate behavior" is different than an affordance, which is the possible relationships between a surface and an agent, a platform and a user. Now, Norman does allow for accidental or unintentional signifiers, which maintains some semblance of our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] Yet, his emphasis on understandability as connected to the communication of "appropriate behavior" could lead toward design governed by determining mechanistic consumption rather than provoking probabilistic production. 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints. Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural. Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76). In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145). I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained. 

Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface. Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions. Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*. Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??). **More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

** NEED to push from affordance to dispositions because i think that will help in the interface history below, talking about the dispositions afforded by roll, codex and kindle -- maybe focus on a few such as closedness and atomization or something?

I could explain affordances as the entangled materialities that construct the space of interface and then walk through the interface history of the bible as book looking for a few specific affordances, such as non-linear access, atomization, and aggregation/collection. Or I could simply describe each interface in terms of its affordances. Roll affords continuous access to text with reinforced sense of relationships of part to whole. Unlike our contemporary romance novels, it would be an onerous task to peek at the end of a story with this roll interface. Roll offers protection of writings and a kind of focus on a particular portion of text by only exposing bits of the text at a time to the user. In the end, I am deciding to stick to one notion of interface, user with platform, rather than push toward the multilayered interface of user-platform-user. 

## Bible as Interface: Roll Bible ##

On of the key things to remember as we explore the many interfaces of bible throughout history is that these interfaces all borrow from each other and media transitions are never total.

Before bible became Bible, it was book. Our concept of book has become so deeply entangled with the dominant book technology of nearly the last two millennia, the codex, that we forget that book has not always been codex. Depending on how broadly we want to define book and its relationship to writing, we could imagine book going all the way back to cave walls and stone tablets. I won't take us all the way down that road here to avoid the detours it might provide, but in the life of bible as book, it is at least important to consider the codexes immediate technological ancestor, the roll.^[as a future project, I would like to come back to this point and explore the relationship between the two tablets of exodus and the evolution of bible as cultural icon as Tim beal describes (total, closed, authoritative, etc.). I would start with William blakes plates of Moses with the tablets looking just like a coded.] The roll was the most common book format for literature and religious texts from ???? to ???? C.E. We find roll books mentioned by authors in the ancient world and in the bible itself. βιβλιον is the Greek word often translated "book" in the Septuagint and the New Testament. Yet, this word for book that becomes the signifier for the cultural phenomenon of christian scripture, and so much more, always refers to something otherwise than a codex in these ancient Greek texts. Here are a few examples (translations my own):

* LXX Exodus 24.17 - "And taking *the book* (το βιβλιον) of the covenant, he read it into the ears of the people and they said, 'All things, which the Lord said, we will do and we will hear.'"
* LXX Nehemiah 8.8 - "And they read in the *book* (βιβλίω) of the law of God, and Ezra taught and ordered [them] in knowledge of the Lord, and the people understood when he read."
* 2 Timothy 4.13 - "When you come, bring the cloak, which I left in Troas with Carpus, and *the books* (τα βιβλια), especially the parchments."

In English translation, with our deep assumption of book as codex, it is easy to read these passages and picture these ancient readers holding a giant leather bound codex. Yet, such a thing didn't even exist at the time of these writings. Rolls were regularly used in early gatherings for worship in communities that came to be known as Jewish. As an example, the scriptures mentioned in the gospel of Luke, from which Jesus read was a roll.^[Timothy Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, offers a detailed look at this scene in the gospel of Luke and the way Jesus would have used the roll as an interface for reading. It is an excellent reminder that books and bibles have not always been in codex form.] 

As an interface, the roll offers a two handed user experience when reading that combines the analog, a continuity, and the digital, discrete bits. The typical roll book consists of several sheets of papyrus or parchment, glued together from edge to edge, written on one side in columnar fashion and rolled up for easy storage and protection. To read, a user would use one hand to unroll in the direction of reading, right to left in Hebrew, left to write in Greek, and the other hand to reroll the read portions of the text. A more contemporary, but already out of date, technology that emulates the mechanics of a roll is a cassette tape. If you can imagine rolling the two spools of a cassette tape by hand and reading for text on the tape, that is similar to how users interfaced with the roll. In fact, some rolls had handles that functioned like spools to enable the user to more easily move back and forth through the book. Imagine the inefficiency and frustration in this interface. Once you get to the end of a roll book, a user has to unroll (or is it reroll?) all the way back to the beginning to read again. I can imagine an ancient library staffing a circulation station with aspiring student scribes or scholars, where their only task was to roll back books from end to beginning after they had been used by a patron. Perhaps one of the reasons we find author attribution and colophon at the end of ancient roll manuscripts is because users often didn't rewind. 

The columns of writing in a roll book effectively deliniated what we would call pages today as a user would roll with both hands in concert until a single column or maybe a few columns of text were visible, they would read that column, and then would roll again when ready to move on. In this sense, roll as interface offered the user both a linear analog^[I would rather find other words to describe this difference rather than analog/digital. The important point to make in all interface analysis is that rarely do we have a binary situation because interfaces as relationships afford more than one type of use.] experience of rolling through the trajectory of a book along with a kind of digital processing of the discrete bits of text encountered column by column. Unlike a cassette tape, but much like the page turn of the codex, rolling to expose one or a few columns of text at a time breaks up the experience of a text, even if only for a second. This horizontal roll was not the only interface available for reading and writing use in antiquity, it was simply the preferred interface for longer texts and became the dominant roll book form for Israelite scriptures. Shorter decrees, contracts and letters could be found in a vertical arrangement with the rolling mechanism the same as the horizontal roll, but in a different orientation and the writing was continuous along the roll, rather than being written in discrete columns. With the absence of the columnar interruptions, the vertical roll provided a more continuous reading experience for the user than the horizontal roll.^[This vertical roll interface is akin to our contemporary relationship with reading on a web page, but with significant differences I will point out later when we consider the internet as an interface of bible.] Yet, if a user allowed for multiple columns to be in view at once when reading from a horizontal roll, it would be possible to time rolling over a first column while reading a second column to reveal a third column, and so on. 

This roll book was the interface for bible users of early antiquity. As I mentioned above, the reading of scripture in the synagogue of Luke 4 portrays the use of this roll interface for bible. If we read the 2nd letter to Timothy attributed to Paul the apostle, we see an explicit mention of his use of rolls as Timothy is asked to bring the rolls (biblia), especially the parchments. Vast material manuscript evidence from Qumran and Cairo Geniza and Oxyryncus all provide examples of bible as roll. What relationship with text might this roll offer users of bible? The linear access to text offers a spatial sense of where each portion of text is in relationship to the whole. In fact, a user has to physically pass through the whole to get to any part and the rolls in each hand get bigger and smaller, providing a visual cue as to how close a user is to one end or the other. Perhaps this interface influences the rabbinic exegetical notion of all parts must be read in relationship to the whole (WHAT IS THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THIS). This does not mean that all of the content of bible had to be in one roll and it certainly was not at this stage of development. We have evidence of bible rolls containing one single writing only, such as the Isaiah roll found at Qumran. Other bible rolls contain combinations of writings, such as the Torah scroll that contains the first five writings of the Hebrew scriptures together in one roll. Theoretically, the length of a roll was unbounded, allowing for endless collecting of writings in one interface. Yet, due to usability, it seems that roll lengths stayed limited to at most approximately ?? long. The two handed interface with rolls demanded some limits on scalability, which in turn led to selectivity in collecting writings together in a single interface. 

How might we talk about the Isaiah roll as an interface in ways that might exceed what we imagine when thinking about the Isaiah roll as a container. In fact, we can begin with the name, Isaiah roll. We tend to name these rolls and other book interfaces by the content they contain or even the assumed author of the text. In antiquity, this attribution of authorship is dubious at best given the common practice of pseudepigaphy.^[Give a citation or two for people to explore the role of ]What if we imagined the story told by the text of the roll as only one affordance of the interface that is

### Bible as Interface: Codex Bible ###

This roll interface was the dominant bible interface until near the turn of the first century of the common era, when a different technology for book begins to emerge, the codex. Codex is the antique technical term for book as we know it today. The definition offered by Roberts and Skeat in *The Birth of the Codex*, states that a codex is “a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers.”^[Colin H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat, The Birth of the Codex (London: Oxford University Press, 1983), 1.] This is a helpful and precise definition, which highlights the material mashup that codex represents. The fastening of multiple writing surfaces together at one end so that the writing surfaces fold together, face to face, comes from the wooden tablets commonly used by the Romans in antiquity. This collection of wood frames filled with wax is where codex gets its name, with codae being Latin for wood. In order to be of practical use for longer writings such as literature, poetry, or scripture, a shift was made to the same type of writing and reading surface as the roll, typically papyrus or parchment. So, the codex becomes a mashup of two writing and reading technologies at the time, the wax tablet and the roll. The main structural difference between roll and codex arises from the way in which sheets are attached together. Rather than gluing sheets together at an edge in sequence to make a long continuous roll, a codex is made by folding sheets into bundles called quires and then fastening one or more quires at one long edge. The bare minimum material needed to constitute a codex is more than one sheet of material and some kind of binding at the spine. This new interface, though carrying forward continuities with existing technologies, afforded new user relationships.^[The ancient helpdesk parody video that has circulated on youtube provides a helpful, though hyperbolic, depiction of the assumptions we make about codex as a technology since we are so familiar with it.]

Derived from its ancestors, the wax tablet, the leaf tablet^[See Graham Stanton, Jesus and Gospel (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 174, for a discussion of the leaf tablets found at Vindolanda.] and the notebook, the codex provided a number of potential technological advantages as compared to the roll. Numerous examples have been suggested, such as portability, capacity, and flexibility.^[Cite a few examples of people who list these advantages, Gamble, etc.] For example, Martial’s late first century promotion of the new codex technology as a fitting format for a traveler’s collection of his poems or other literary classics confirms the accepted value of portability attributed to the codex in antiquity.^[Roberts and Skeat, The Birth of the Codex, 24-25. Even with this affordance of portability offered by the codex, this may not have been an important technological advance for bible in early antiquity, since the scriptures used by early Christians were largely still interfaced in roll.] Allowing for writing on both sides of the writing surface, the codex could hold more text per unit of material and thus smaller, more portable books could be produced. On the other hand, since the codex could theoretically bind an unlimited number of pages and both sides of these pages were used for writing, the codex could hold an enormous and unlimited amount of text within one book. This tremendous capacity also allowed for increased collection of writings together in one volume. Yet, as we saw with the roll, the pragmatics of user interaction with interface placed some limit on the practical capacity of a single codex. The flexibility of the codex is confined mostly to the multiquire format, where the binding could be removed to facilitate rearrangement, addition, and subtraction of sections. These advantages of the codex were exploited to different degrees in different times and places.

I agree with James O’Donnell, who suggests that the most valuable technological advantage provided by the codex is non-linear access to text.^[James Joseph O'Donnell, Avatars of the Word: From Papyrus to Cyberspace (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1998), 54, says, "The history of medieval manuscripts is the history of the exploitation of the possibilities of the codex page.”] Non-linear access captures one of the fundamental technical differences between a scroll and a codex. As we described above, the text of a roll has to be accessed in a linear fashion, from beginning to end, even if not all of the text is read. With a codex, access to a text can begin at any point without regard for what precedes or follows, and need not proceed in any sort of linear fashion. I prefer the language of non-linear access to describe this technological innovation over phrases such as “ease of reference” or “random access.” The phrase “ease of reference” does not adequately describe the fundamental transition
in the user interface for text processing that accompanied the shift in technology from roll to codex and traditional reference aids did not become common, even in codices, until the fourth century C.E. Though random access was certainly possible with a codex, this seems like extreme language to describe the phenomenon. Reading and writing processes rarely invlove or necessitate truly random access to a text.^[More recent machine reading techniques such as those used in Natural Language Processing tasks such as topic modeling can involve access to text that approaches randomness.] “Non-linear” terminology maintains the idea of user relating with interface and clearly describes the technological affordance brought about by the codex.

Thanks to the collaborative work of the British Library, the Vatican Library, ADD TWO others here, we have the amazing ability to explore one particular example of bible as codex in Codex Sinaiticus.^[I have a particular affinity for this codex both because I have spent some time exploring the manuscript itself but also because of its name. It gets its name from the Mount Sinai monastery where the first portion of the remains were found. Though the relationship between the tablets at Mount Sinai in the biblical story of Moses bringing the commandments to the people and the codex that bears this mountains name is entirely accidental, I find great resonance between the cultural impact of these ancient stone tablets and the codex that is said to give us a window to the "original" text of the New Testament.] The enactment of the Codex Sinaiticus project itself raises all kinds of interesting questions regarding bible as interface by combining digitization techniques, xml encoding, and web design to provide a collection of online interfaces to offer contact with this ancient codex interface. One of the great fourth century bible codicies, alongside Alexandrinus and Vaticanus, Codex Siniaticus is thought to be produced in the middle 300's and contains a majority of what is today considered the Christian bible, with a few particularities and omissions.^[Add a note on the precise contents of CS and its potential relationship to the requested codicies requested of Eusebius by the monarchy.] Siniaticus is a parchment codex of substantial size with 400 leaves remaining consisting of ?? quires and no remaining covers. The pages are large, measuring ?? by ?? and the writing is in four columns per page of uncial Greek in scripta continua. Again, it is interesting to note the palimpsestuous continuation of columnar writing that is carried over from the roll. The material reading interface of codex does nothing to suggest the need to write in multiple columns on a single page, which was a waste of expensive real estate. Writing all the way acrros the page would save space, allowing a codex to store more, and thus would cost less for materials. Yet, the presence of the roll remains in codex as an echo of the interface that preceded it. As was typical for high culture manuscripts of this time period, Sinaiticus's columns are fairly uniform in size as are the intercolumnar and outer page margins. The outer page margins are massive, which may have contributed to the rich annotative life of the manuscript. 

As stated by the curators of the Codex Sinaiticus project, one of the most interesting aspects of this beautiful ancient manuscript is the rich annotative life it betrays. Here, in these markings at the margins, we find a material performance of the proximity of interface. Whether deemed as corrections, additions, theological guides, or reading indicators, these annotations demonstrate a participatory reading process that emulates the probabilistic production championed by Drucker. One of the potential provocations to this probabilistic production is the use of scripta continua. Scripta continua is writing that includes no spaces and no punctuation to identify word breaks or phrase endings. The regular patterns of the Greek language allow for fairly predictable and consistent parsing of this uninterrupted string of characters, but there are inevitably places where the algorithms do not produce only one possible reading. There is something about the absence of spaces and punctuation that contributes to probabilistic production. It is irrelevant to question whether this potential ambiguity was an intentional value of ancient authors, but at the very least, it signals a demand for nearness on the reader's part to pay close attention to these interruptions. At the same time, the absence of spaces, which is a strange thing to say since space is usually imagined as the absence of characters, provides a kind of distance that resists a readers mastery of the text. Thus, I argue that scripta continua affords proximity in ways that our familiar and precisely punctuated and delineated text does not. Sinaiticus provides a stunning reminder that proximity is not only afforded in new media interfaces, but has been around since bible began to be written. 

Sinaiticus is the oldest known manuscript of the "complete" New Testament as it is known today and a large portion of the Septuagint, the Hebrew Bible in Greek. This is a massive interface that most definitely does not participate in the affordance of portability often celebrated of the codex. Siniaticus is a crowning example of the exploitation of the collective and consolidating affordances of the codex technology. Bringing such a large collection of texts together in one volume was entirely impractical for everyday use, but was a strong signal of the unity and totality of the Christian scriptures. It is hard not to imagine some cultural and cognitive correlation between the growing debates about what writings ought to be included in the authorized collection of Christian scriptures and this exquisite exemplar of codex as container.^[Cite Bob Kraft's article on canon consciousness and the codex here as well as other dismissals by Hurtado, etc.] As I noted above in the general description of codex as interface, manuscripts at this time still lacked most of the reference markers with which we have become so familiar today. So, Codex Sinaiticus most definitely demonstrates the affordance of non-linear access, because any of the writings in this vast collection in one volume could be accessed immediately, without having to process through each column of text to get there, either backward or forward. Yet, we see no evidence of expanded capacities for non-linear access as would be provided by page numbers, chapter and verse markings, indexes, etc.

## Bible as Book: Critical Scholarly Edition

## Bible as Book: Kindle Bible

Of all the possible platforms I could select to explore bible as book in the digital age, I have chosen to focus on Kindle because it is a familiar and ubiquitous platform that continues to try to perform as book in significant ways. It doesn't even make sense to count the number of bibles available on Kindle. Depending on the day, your location, your search habits, and your demographics, a web search for "kindle bible" will return a different set of options. Already, in this kind of search, we are performing the probabilistic production of interface, because each search has the potential to produce something new based on different user variables and on the constantly emerging options for bible on the Kindle platform. From my particular location in the USA as a bible scholar who does a fair bit of web searching related to bible, one of the top search results when I pass a simple query of "kindle bible" is a Kindle Book titled "The Bible - The Holy Bible Formatted for Your eReader."^[Paste link here] This title alone deserves some comment. First of all, the main title of the book is simply "The Bible" without any qualifications or further limitations or identifications. The subtitle offers a small amount more to distinguish this bible interface from the others available on Kindle.^[I am at a loss for why the word "Holy" is added to the subtitle of this book. Perhaps this is a reinforcement of Timothy Beal's suggestion that bible has become a cultural artifact that extends far beyond any sense of content to a cultural sensibility of authority, completeness, OTHERS... Perhaps, including "The Holy Bible" in the subtitle of this particular Kindle book differentiates it in terms of content from other bibles, such as the Python Bible or the Golf Bible. Could this mean that "Holy" has become a synonym for Christian in common parlance?] This bible is a bible "Formatted for Your eReader." Even in the title, this book is taking seriously the role of interface in the construction of this bible. In this title, there is no mention of version or author or date or language or oder of the text within. What is foregrounded is interface. 

If you are willing to spend the $1.99 to purchase this bible interface and you read the "about this book" information, it becomes even more evident that this bible builds its unique identity on the expansion of non-linear access offered by the digital affordances of indexing, anchors, and search. Touch screen navigation, hyperlinked table of contents and chapter/verse markings, and a simplified search mechanism are all the ways this particular bible interface is advertised as unique. The only mention of the particularities of the content of the text inside is a simple statement that this kindle bible "contains the complete old and new testaments...ASV Version."^[See https://www.amazon.com/Bible-Holy-Formatted-Your-eReader-ebook/dp/B0032UYGE6 accessed on February 17, 2017.] Here we find the only container language in the entire description and framing of this kindle bible. Otherwise, this bible is defined by its interface affordances exclusively. The only mention of author or source of this kindle bible is the grammatically redundant "ASV Version" fragment in the description, with American Standard listed as the author of the book. Following the author link for American Standard provided by Amazon leads to a blank profile with only this one bible in the list of related items. The American Standard Version is a public domain text of the bible published initially in 1901. There is a vast and interesting history to this English translation of the bible, but this kindle bible pays no attention to this either in the advertising of the bible or in the bible's introduction. We can see here a bible that is entirely focused on the use of it as an interface, not on the content it contains. 

Lest we imagine that the codex has been replaced entirely by this new interface, this kindle bible uses the title page from a print codex bible as its "cover" art. Here we find a material representation of the palimpsestuous process of media translation, with an image of a print codex page representing the interface of a kindle book designed to extend the non-linear access affordances introduced by the codex into new realms made possible by internet technologies.^[This use of a print codex page to signify the bible, rather than the titles of the writings in the bible, a list of characters and stories, or even some depiction of christianity or God, shows how deeply embedded the identity of bible is in the print codex.] This kindle bible takes seriously the possibilities of its use and does not assume user familiarity with the particular affordances available, so with the most emphasized line in the description, this bible offers links to YouTube videos on how to use the bible.^[Rather than using the affordance of linkability offered by the Kindle platform to deliver or embed these training videos in the book itself, for some reason the producers of this bible elected to provide a link to click to be emailed links to videos. From a user perspective, this seems like a failure of leveraging the possibilities of the platform. Yet, because Kindle books continue to perform the stability and fixicity of codex, meaning they do not allow updates like other interfaces might, this approach could afford providing better videos as they develop them or adding additional videos as issues arise with the interface. A more fitting strategy may have been to provide a link to a YouTube channel that could then be a dynamic library of support videos but with a durable link and landing space that could be provided in a stable interface such as a kindle book.] This may seem like a silly item to highlight in a bible, but it makes a fascinating point about the assumptions we have about users and codicies that are no longer operable in these emerging book interfaces. If content is just one part of interface, then these changes in modes of access will inevitably change the relationship between user and platform, thus will require new skills and new intuitions.  One of the most interesting developments in the media translation of bible from print to kindle is the ability to use this kindle bible on an actual Kindle device, a laptop, an iPhone, an iPad, android devices, and the list gets larger every day. In a sense, what I have purchased from Amazon in this kindle bible is permission to participate in a plethora of interfaces. 

This is one of the distinct differences between newer media interfaces of bible and the manuscript and print interfaces we have looked at previously. To own a manuscript or a print bible is to have a singular material object with which a user relates. Certainly, there were variabilities in the encounter between user and platform in codex interfaces based on historical period, social location, and cultural dynamics at any given time. Yet, in both manuscript and print codicies, the material affordances of the book were constant for a given book. In the print age, people could own more than one bible, but each bible was a distinct entity and did not require any other technology of access in order to interface with it.^[Of course, we could speak of language as a technology required to access a manuscript or print codex, but for our purposes here, we can assume language competence in the textual language in all of these interface examples. This assumption is not transferable to the media literacies necessary for bible interface beyond book, which points again to the significance of this kindle bible including YouTube instructional videos on how to use this bible.] This new requirement for access to texts, ensuring that there is an adequate software layer to interpret the encoding of a particular textual interface has become a major concern in archival and preservation movements in the digital humanities.^[Provide a few examples of this conversation in library science and DH circles to highlight the complexity of the issue.] So, in order to participate in the interface that is this kindle bible, I have to purchase the bible and I have to have access to Kindle Reader software, either in a web browser or as a downloaded application on my laptop or mobile device. So as a user of this bible on an iPhone, I actually have at minimum three interfaces at play when I use this kindle bible-the interface of the phone, the interface of the reader application, and the interface of the bible. Though a manuscript or print codex has many components to its interface, such as covers, paper material, and ink color, these all combine to make a stable and singular material platform that is not heavily impacted by the user's participation in the interface. To alter this platform, a user would go find a different bible. A major shift as we move to interfaces that involve internet and mobile technologies is a vast increase in user participation in constructing and selecting the material properties of the bible platform. A quick comparison of using this bible on a MacBook and on an iPhone can illustrate this expansion of user participation in the flexibility of interface.

On my MacBook, I am working with a 12 inch diagonal screen and keyboard and trackpad as my primary contact with the reader application and the bible. To use this kindle bible on my MacBook, I open up my web browser of choice, which is Safari in this case, and I type in the web address read.amazon.com. This website prompts me for a username and password, perhaps similar to the lock and key we see on some ancient manuscripts. Once I have verified my identity with the reader application layer of this interface, I am presented with a view of my entire library that I have purchased from Amazon, the maker of the Kindle reader platform.^[Though the economic and social relationship between Amazon and the producers of the particular books that are available in kindle offers another interesting aspect to these new media interfaces, I will leave that discussion to others.] When I use this kindle bible, I am always also carrying around my entire library. Using books in the constant context of a library is not entirely foreign to codex interfaces, because particularly in antiquity, many people only had access to books through libraries.^[Cite some mentions of rare private book use and the role of libraries in antiquity.] Yet, we can see here an expansion of the portability affordance often associated with the codex. The kindle interface not only allows me to carry around the bible in my pocket or my book bag (pun intended), but my entire library. Though the kindle interface does not yet provide a global search across the content of all items in the library, you can imagine the increased affordance of intertextual engagement as I can move from bible to *Dubliners* in the seconds it takes to make two clicks. The lack of searchability across books is one of the reasons I still consider kindle as a book platform, performing codex in a digital space. Once an interface begins to push beyond the boundedness of a codex, we are moving toward something  This library affordance provided by the kindle platform strikes me in some ways as analogous to the ways Timothy Beal has spoken of bible itself as more of a library than a book. In his book, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, which happens to be in my kindle library, Beal wonderfully points out that bible resists some of the univocal sensibilities of the codex because it is a collection of multiple voices from multiple contexts and time periods dealing with a plurality of cultural and historical issues.^[Beal, *Rise and Fall, ??]. So, even before the rise of pocket storage devices that can provide participation in thousands of books at the tap of a finger or simple voice command, bible as codex was already demonstrating the affordance of collection provided by a library and the encounter with plurivocality and difference. This kind of collecting could provide some distance in an interface insofar as the different voices collected together challenge attempts to consolidate bible into a single unified voice. 

Once I choose *The Bible: The Holy Bible Formatted for Your eReader* from the the kindle library view by clicking on its cover, the bible takes up the entire space of the browser page. Again, with the distinct emphasis on use in this bible, the first "page" offered to the user is titled "How to most effectively use this Bible on your Kindle." This introductory material is framed as a frequently asked questions page, which is a common feature of many online technological interfaces and communicates a focus on users of the platform. As we saw in the marketing of this bible, all of the FAQs have to do with navigation and the affordances for non-linear access possible in this interface, very little mention of the specifics of the content or the composition of the texts accessed in this interface. After this short introduction on use, there is nothing further in terms of front matter besides the linked table of contents, which provides one of the material media translations of non-linear access from earlier forms of codex. Instead of providing a list of content items with their respective starting page numbers that a user can use to thumb through the book to locate a particular content set, the beginning of each content unit is linked in this table of contents so a user can simply click and be taken to that location in the bible. The Kindle layer of the interface allows the user to return to the table of contents from anywhere in the bible if needed. 

Throughout this discussion of the kindle bible interface thus far, I have consistently put the word "page" in quotes to indicate that though the construct of the page is entirely operative in the kindle book, it is a site of significant change in terms of user participation in the interface. Though not demanded by the technologies involved in providing a digital platform for the use of books, the Kindle interface has kept the codex page as its primary navigational structure. Much like turning the page of a codex, in the kindle bible, a user is presented with one unit of text at a time and there are navigational aids to move forward or backward in a book, which corresponds to left and right horizontal movement respectively in English language books. As we have all experienced, a browser also affords vertical navigation as we scroll up and down in a web "page." Kindle books pay homage to the codex page by maintaining the horizontal navigation through discrete units of text, which mimics the pages of paper or papyrus bound at a spine. In the browser interface, a user can use arrow keys on the keyboard or click the arrows provided in the pages These pages also have a header and footer that are consistent throughout. The page header keeps the title of the book present throughout the book and the footer provides a location indicator, which functions as a media translation of page numbers in a manuscript or print codex. When Kindle first released its platform, all kindle books used this location numbering as the means of locating a user within the space of the book sequentially. Due to market demands to have better crossover reference capabilities with print versions of the same book, Kindle introduced page numbers into their platform in 2011.^[See https://www.wired.com/2011/02/amazon-adds-real-page-numbers-to-kindle/ for an example of the kinds of pressures driving this demand for page numbers.]
