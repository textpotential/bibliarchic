# INTRODUCTION: TRANSLATING BOOK #

The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our reading habits. With the entangled histories of bible and book--the bible is, after all, the book of books--this emerging media age and its transformation of reading practices forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. I propose that digital media create the possibility to engage bible as an anarchic interface. I call it an *interface* in order to stress that bible readers are more than just passive consumers of the words they read; they are also makers of meaning. I describe this interface as *anarchic* because the word’s etymology means both without a beginning and without a reign. Thus, an anarchic interface is a space of contact where meaning is produced without the reign of an original. 

So much modern biblical interpretation has been about finding the original meaning in the text, but such a quest is at best elusive and at worst an illusion. An anarchic interface provides the opportunity to think of bible and its reading practices entirely differently. Perhaps we are not thinking about these practices entirely differently. Instead, maybe just suggesting use practices that fit with an emerging media landscape. Thinking of bible as an interface rather than simply as a container for content allows us to explore the way emerging technologies can translate and transform enduring traditions of bible reading into the coming media age in ways that transcend the usual media binaries of writer/reader, producer/consumer, form/content, right/wrong.

Why bother? Internet is changing how we imagine books and our relationship with them. Bible is infinitely tied to the technologies of book, so as technologies transform our notion of book, they will indefinitely change our relationship with bible. One way to talk about how technologies change our relationship with books, thus bible, is through changes in our relationship to nearness and distance. 

Bible has always been bound to book. The history of bible is so deeply intertwined with the 


Looking for an alternative to the container model of interface, where the structure of a space dictates the consumptive actions of a user, Johanna Drucker provides a notion of interface as a zone of encounter. With books, this zone or space is where reader encounters text and something is made in the entanglement of contingencies and possibilities of that particular moment of encounter. Affordances are a common concept in interface design that will help us explore the ways in which physical characteristics of an interface shape and are shaped by the possible actions of a particular user to construct the possible set of relationships between a user and an interface. As we consider the design of book interfaces that provide this space of encounter where something is made in the practice of reading, I will advocate for attention to an affordance of anarchy that dethrones the governing role of a singular original without eradicating useful historical relations. Bible reading communities throughout history have provided some models for this anarchic interface and can provide important guidance and wisdom as we explore emerging media capacities for our relationship with books.^[Add a section here, perhaps, defining a few of the basic terms I use that I will not spend a lot of time defining or will not define more fully later. Terms such as technology, digital, media/um, bible, book, etc.]

## Emergence of a Medium ##

This question of bible as interface emerged for me through an exploration of the material media transition from roll to codex as the dominant book technology in the early centuries of the common era. We have evidence of one man's experience of this media transition early in antiquity. The first century Roman poet, Marshall, reflects on encountering his own writings in this new technological form. Marshall says, "" (). The codex form of book has been so deeply naturalized as the preeminent form of learning and knowledge for me, that this historical reminder that codex was once a novel and even questionable book technology helps contextualize the current media revolution we are experiencing with the rise of online reading practices. I have spent my formative academic years in a major media transition from the dominance of print to the proliferation of electronic book interfaces such as Print Document Format (PDF), books on the internet, and the Kindle reader on my iPhone. This present upheaval in technological mediation of book has made me more attuned to the cultural dynamics that may have been at work in the early centuries of the common era as the codex became more prevalent in literature, law, and religious writings. 

Robert Kraft was an early pioneer in these questions about the relationship between our present media transition from print to internet and the shift from scroll to codex in antiquity. Focused particularly on the notion of canon, Kraft articulated the possible impacts at work in these somewhat analagous transitions, worlds apart in terms of history and culture, saying "For many years now, I have wondered whether the technological change from the scroll format to the large-scale codex influenced, at least in some situations, perceptions about 'the bible,' and especially the extent to which the classical Christian concept of a closed or exclusive 'canon' of scripture depended on that development" (Kraft 2000). Even more impressively, Kraft challenged his colleagues and the guild to which he belonged by consistently performing these theoretical explorations of medium and bible using the tools and principles operative in the newly emerging internet medium. In the piece quoted above, we can see the attempts to translate print structures such as footnotes into the internet "page."^[Even the fact that we call web objects pages suggests the durable presence of the codex and print on our media sensibilities. Yet, as Walter Ong noted in his *Technologizing the Word* (), there is a secondary orality at work in the "scrolling" we use to navigate these "pages" of the internet. The language we use to talk about emerging technologies provides a strong reminder of the palimpsestuous nature of media translation.] 

Using simple notation such as "---" to separate between a paragraph and the related notes, "===" to separate between notes and the next paragraph, and "\\#/" to designate a note, Kraft attempted to translate the familiar print medium into the continuous scrolled "page" of the internet. Though this notation was extremely inefficient for the editing process, I admire Kraft for having the courage to experiment with new media in ways that had the potential to translate to those who remained steeped in the more familiar medium of print. His performance of the difficulties of this new medium provided a significant object lesson for the theoretical questions he posed. He was showing and telling at the same time. Of course, this draft electronic writing eventually gets published in print as chapter 14 in *The Canon Debate* (McDonald and Sanders 2002). It is the both/and of Kraft's approach that is most instructive for us both practically and theoretically. As Marshall McLuhan reminds us, all new media contain their predecessors, so it is no surprise that print artifacts such as pages and footnotes remain even in this web writing medium (McLuhan 1964, 10). Practically, Kraft found a way to explore new terrain in the process of academic writing without having to eradicate or cease to participate in more traditional print forms of scholarly production. This combination of curiosity and generosity shapes my approach in this project. 

I continue in the line of questioning pioneered by Kraft, still wondering how the evolving material interfaces of bible, the technologies of bible as book, might "[affect our] perceptions about 'texts,' 'books,' 'reading,' and the like..." (Kraft 2000). My exploration here of bible as anarchic interface and the technological ramifications of bible as book will not endeavor to unpack all of the potential intersections between the emergence of the codex as a predominant medium for christian scriptures and the difficult process of Judeo-Christian differentiation, or lack thereof, during the first four centuries of the common era.^[See Daniel Boyarin's *Borderlines* for an analysis of the demarcation between Jews and Christians in early antiquity. See ] Yet, it will become clear in the conversation partners I have chosen in this project that this question of the difference between Jews and Christians and their relationships with their books is never far from my mind. 

## The Emergence of a Medium ##

From the birth of the codex to the fall of the bible, medium has mattered in the life of bible both in its necessary entanglement with content and in its significant social effects. In *The Birth of the Codex*, Roberts and Skeat give us a careful look at the storied material history of the technology that has come to dominate our cultural idea of book, the codex (Roberts and Skeat 1970). Nearly half of the pages of their own codex are devoted to the role of early Christian practices of scripture in the rise of the codex to prominence as a book technology, with this bold claim emerging from their analysis of the manuscript data:

> Even if we give this extended meaning to the term Biblical, the conclusion remains the same, namely that when the Christian Bible first emerges into history the books of which it was composed are always written on papyrus and are always in codex form. There could not be a greater contrast in format with the non-Christian book of the second century, a contrast all the more remarkable when we recall that Egypt, where all these early Christian texts were found, was the country where the papyrus roll originated and where the status of the roll as the only acceptable format for literature was guaranteed by Alexandria with its dominating position in the world of books (Roberts and Skeat 1970, 42).^[In earlier performances of this dissertation, I embedded images of block quotes from the interface in which I read these quotes, instead of ingesting quotes textually into the word processing format of the rest of the work. I used the images of quotes to signal the multimedia and intertextual nature of my work. Allowing the images to interrupt the flow of typed letters can encourage us to engage these other voices in the project as material artifacts that may have different material affordances than those at work in this document. Both the content offered by these conversation partners and the shape of the interface in which I engaged them matter.]

Acknowledging the difficulty of firmly establishing the ‘biblical’ category and signaling their sensitivity to the narrow provenance of manuscript evidence, all in Egypt, Roberts and Skeat still resoundingly suggest that bible as book begins exclusively as a papyrus codex. Newer manuscript evidence and different approaches to categories have challenged the ‘always’ of this conclusion. Yet, the strangeness of this early Christian preference for codex has been reinforced by many more recent explorations of this evidence.^[Examples to come.]

In a book that deeply shaped my own ideas about the adoption of codex technology by Christians, *Books and Readers*,[^4] Harry Gamble focuses more on the readerly use of early Christian texts than on their literary production (Gamble 1995). Though he may differ in his conclusions from Roberts and Skeat, there is little doubt that bible played a part in the emergence of a new interface.^[Add a sample from Gamble here about emergence of codex in xian use and add a note about other perspectives on role of bible in codex development - Gamble, Hurtado, etc. Offer p.oxy 1075 and nongbri article as an example.] In my own work on the book as a technology for scripture in antiquity, I found a combination of Gamble, Epp, and O'Donnell provided a compelling picture of the usefulness of the portable notebook becoming associated with Christian leaders, and hence with authority.^[Expand a bit here and cite Epp, O’Donnell, and Wagner.]

Add a section in the introduction or in the bible chapter discussing the relationship between bible and scripture and specifically how I am using bible in this project. See note in chapter 2 from Wimbush. This would be a brief definition of bible here pointing to a further expansion at the beginning of chapter 3.

## Twilight of an Icon ##

The first chapter of Timothy Beal’s book *The Rise and Fall of the Bible* is titled ‘The End of the Word as we Know It,’ and he feels fine.

> The icon of the Bible, The Book of books, is in the process of deconstruction.
And that, I believe, is a good thing. It's the end of the Word as we know it, and I feel fine. The Word as we know it is not very old, as we have already begun to see, and it's a distraction from the Scriptures themselves. Its end is an occasion to find a fresh approach to the Bible that is truer not only to its content but also to its fascinating history (Beal 2011, location 371).^[See [this music video](https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY) for a sense of the culturalreference embedded in this chapter title.]

The cultural iconicity of 'the Bible' as 'the Book of books' that is undergoing deconstruction is the bible as authoritative, univocal, practical, accessible, comprehensive, and exclusive (Beal 2011, location 121-122). As Beal also notes, it is not a coincidence that this transformation of the bible as cultural icon coincides with a major cultural translation of the book as a medium.

> Suffice it to say that the end of print culture and the rise of a digital, networked media culture means the end of the book as we know it. And the end of the book as we know it cannot be divorced from the end of the Word, The Book of books, as we know it (Beal 2011, location 1161).

Just as in antiquity, bible played a role in the emergence of a new book technology, so today, bible as book is entangled in a transition from the reign of print to a proliferation of interfaces in our emerging media age.[^book_as_container]

[^book_as_container]: Maybe add a section on Bible as Container - Perhaps a short explanation here of how container notions of bible are operative in contemporary discourse. Could we use Tim's code for twitter analysis to demonstrate the common conception of bible as container?

## Medium Matters ##

In *Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man*, Marshall McLuhan points us toward the cracks in the reign of print, that illustrious descendent of the codex, in the face of an emerging electronic age (McLuhan 1964). McLuhan reminds us that technologies (media) are extensions of ourselves and that the message of every medium is its effect on our social relations.

> In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium-that is, of any extension of ourselves-result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology (McLuhan 1964, 7-8).

Beyond the obvious and important entanglement of form and content, McLuhan emphasizes the impact of technologies on human relationship with the world and one another through a ‘change of scale’ not simply a newness of kind.

> What we are considering here, however, are the psychic and social consequences of the designs or patterns as they amplify or accelerate existing processes. For the “message” of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs (McLuhan 1964, 8).

Here, McLuhan challenges our binary tendencies between new and old and suggests that media emerge as a change in ‘existing processes’ that inevitably have social consequences. It is precisely this change in existing processes we find in the amplification of non-linear access from the emergence of the codex to the ubiquity of digital search. McLuhan suggests that the content of every ‘new’ medium is another existing medium (McLuhan 1964, 8). Just as the codex performed the multiple columns per page of a scroll, so internet search performs and amplifies the print index. I refer to this phenomenon of media building upon and containing its predecessors as *material media translation*. The language of translation is helpful here because it signals that all media transformations involve a negotiation between new and old with inevitable loss and gain. I use the phrase 'material media' to qualify this translation to differentiate this process from the common process of translation of texts into other forms of media such as sound and film. In material media translation, it is the materiality of the interface of the medium that is translated, not simply its 'content,' whatever that might entail.

There are two theoretical foundations for this notion of material media translation. First, Marshall McLuhan offers two insights into the process of emerging media. He suggests that all new media contain their predecessors, such that there is a continuity of connectedness in the process of change, not stark transitions between media.^[McLuhan, *Understanding Media*, ??.] Writing in multiple vertical columns on a page of a codex is a good example of the continuity of the roll within the newer book technology. Continuing the codex structure of page turning in the Kindle book interface offers another example of new media continuing the affordances of their ancestors. Relatedly, McLuhan points out that emerging technologies often involve a change in scale of familiar affordances, rather than introducing entirely new interface capacities.^[McLuhan, *Understanding Media*, ??.] An excellent example of this change in scale is the expansion of the codex's nonlinear access by the Kindle interface. Here, McLuhan describes a holding together of difference and similarity in the process of media evolution that models a process of translation as articulated by the Italian semiotician, Ubaldo Stecconi, who offers the second theoretical framework for this idea of material media translation. Stecconi suggests that the three pillars of translation are similarity, difference, and mediation.^[Stecconi, "Five Reasons Why Semiotics is Good For Translation Studies," 23-34.] I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE DIRECTION STECCONI TAKES THIS NOTION OF MEDIATION AS TARGETS SPEAKING FOR ORIGINALS...

My favorite material metaphor for this process of material media translation is a palimpsest, a manuscript that has been written on, erased, and then written on again. With each new medium writing over an existing medium (or many media) with only partial erasure, material media translation enacts a kind of palimpsest. Below is an image of a page from *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus*,^[[*http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8470433r*](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8470433r)] a fifth century manuscript of biblical texts in Greek, washed and written over in the 12th century with Greek translations of the fourth century Syriac writings of Ephrem the Syrian. This beautiful material enactment of palimpsest, two column miniscule Greek translations of Syriac over single column uncial Greek biblical texts, illustrates marvelously the process of emerging media building upon existing structures to make something new.

In light of this process of material media translation as palimpsest, remembering bible's rich media history will provide a helpful context for imagining how bible might be practiced as interface amidst the changing reading dispositions of our emerging media age. This material media translation of book from manuscript page to mobile screen already has and will continue to shape our reading practices. A closer look at the cultural operations of interface as a zone of encounter that provokes probabilistic production will help us continue to resist the unhelpful dichotomies of new and old,  medium and message. 

## Depicting Palimpsest ##

As I have said before, no media transition is total and all new media continues to embody the forms that came before it. One of the fascinating historical coincidences (or is it a coincidence?) of early antiquity is the simultaneous rise of the codex as a dominant literary form and the rise of Christianity. I find it entirely uninteresting to postulate any direct causality in any direction among this relationship, but we have plenty of indicators that books mattered to the early Judeo-Christian milieu and that bible was a hybrid interface for many. One particular 6th century mosaic from Ravenna, Italy demonstrates this hybrid or multimedia interface beautifully. As many have experienced, Ravenna is full of fantastic and curious early depictions of Christian scenes in mosaic form from the 5th and 6th centuries of the common era. What surprised me as I began my reluctant tour through the ancient tourist sites was the prevalence of books in these early art forms. In fact, there were books everywhere, from the rolls in the hands of the saints around the baptismal font to the famous gospel cabinet in the funerary room. In the context of this discussion about bible as interface and the emergence of codex as a new interface, there is one particular depiction of a gospel writer in the cathedral of San Vitale that highlights the copresence of roll and codex in the interface repertoire of ancient bible users. This particular set of mosaics is dated to the 6th century and the wall depicts all four gospel writers with their typical animal signs. The mosaic of Matthew (Check) depicts him sitting near a writing desk with a codex in his lap and a basket of rolls near the foot of the desk. Even as late as the 6th century, when codex has become the dominant reading and writing interface for most users of the world, high Christian iconography is entirely comfortable depicting the use of both roll and codex in the composition of their sacred writings. So, as a user, the gospel writer would have to participate in multiple interfaces in order to compose bible. 

## Introducing Affordance ##

Affordances were first introduced in by James J. Gibson, a perceptual psychologist, in 1977 in an article titled "The Theory of Affordances" (Gibson 1977). Gibson expands on this theory in his 1979 book, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*, where he offers the definition "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??). An important aspect of Gibson's invention of affordances is their relational nature. An affordance is the relationship between the physical properties of a "surface" and an organism encountering that surface (Gibson 1979, ??). 

Taking Gibson's lead, I will offer an example using codex as a surface engaged or used by a reader.^[Gibson's example is the relationship between an animal and a terrestrial surface. See Gibson 1979, ??.] The physical properties of a codex include flexible pages bound together on one long side with a cover on the front and back. The pages have writing on them. This codex *affords* reading for the reader. More specifically, the codex affords non-linear access to text because of the physical properties of binding on one side and flexible pages instead of being rolled up in one long sheet from one end to the other as in a scroll. This is simply one example of the relationship between physical properties of space and the affordances offered in the relationship with a user.

The critical piece of Gibson's theory is the relational nature of affordances and the way affordances problematize the binary between subject and object (Gibson 1979, ??). An affordance is not simply a property of an object or of a subject. Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant. This sounds a good bit like an interface. Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibilities offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface. ^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that occurs between bible and user.

## Affordance and Interface ##

One limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavior capacities of an organism. In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance. Donald Norman brought Gibson's notion of affordances into the world of human-computer interface design and focused the concept on those actions "perceived" as possible or likely by a user of an interface by combining the operations of affordances, signifiers, and constraints (Norman 2013, 145). Rather than exploring any action made possible by the relationship between the physical properties of an interface and the capacities of a user, Norman focused more on the possible uses that would make sense to a user when encountering an interface.^[In the first chapter of the revised and expanded edition of *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman tells the story of his relationship with Gibson and their fundamental disagreements about the interpretive role of the brain in the relationship between agents and objects (Norman 2013, 12). Norman is clear about his indebtedness to Gibson and the important contribution Gibson made to helping designers pay more attention to the information offered by the physical world.] 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14). If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user. Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces. The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14). Understandably, Norman is focused on intuitive and useful interface design, with primarily the designer in mind, so introducing the property of a signifier to help designers talk about what they are adding to an interface to point to an affordance makes good sense. Yet, one of the reasons I will stay closer to the more generic notion of affordances as we discuss bible as interface is to distance our design and analysis of interfaces from the singular intent of the "appropriate" or "proper" use of an interface as determined by the designer. In Norman's definiton of signifer, we can see this emphasis on the proper at work. He says, "For me, the term *signifier* refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a user" (Norman 2013, 14). This signifer as indicator of "appropriate behavior" is different than an affordance, which is the possible relationships between a surface and an agent, a platform and a user. Now, Norman does allow for accidental or unintentional signifiers, which maintains some semblance of our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] Yet, his emphasis on understandability as connected to the communication of "appropriate behavior" could lead toward design governed by determining mechanistic consumption rather than provoking probabilistic production. 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints. Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural. Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76). In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145). I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained. 

Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface. Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions. Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*. Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??). **More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

** NEED to push from affordance to dispositions because i think that will help in the interface history below, talking about the dispositions afforded by roll, codex and kindle -- maybe focus on a few such as closedness and atomization or something?


## Making a Pathway ##

Building on Johanna Drucker's work with interface theory and the Humanities, I will begin with a look at interface as a way of interrupting the container notion of book and suggesting a greater focus on relationality and reading practices in our discussion of media transitions and reading interface design. Then, based on the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, I will argue for an anarchic relationality that can shape our interface design toward creative encounter that resists emerging media dispositions toward consumption. With the possibility and value of anarchic interface established, I will then trace the importance of interface as media in the life of bible and its reading practices throughout history. 

With bible as anarchic interface established, I will use N. Katherine Hayle’s “media specific analysis” to look back at the performance of anarchic interface on the Talmudic page and in illuminated medieval manuscripts. Then we will analyze a few contemporary bible interfaces in digital media -- Twible, biblegateway.com, and YouVersion’s Bible app -- to evaluate the degree to which they afford anarchy in the practice of reading. In conclusion, I will beckon us forward by offering the blueprints for an experimental bible app that highlight the challenges and possibilities of anarchic interface design and will offer some encouragement in light of the pervasive anxiety about human relationship and reading practices in today's media environment.
