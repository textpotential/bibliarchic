We have now considered interface as a way of thinking about our relationship with books. We have articulated a multilayered theory of interface based on Levinasian proximity that accounts for the entangled interfaces of human-machines-human. Now, we can turn to bible and explore how this proximate theory of interface might help us imagine bible as interface. Why focus on bible as interface here and not some other literary tradition that has had a lasting impact on culture? One of the reasons I ever began considering proximity as a way of describing our relationship with bible was due to a moment in Philip Nemo's interviews with Levinas that hinted at the deep role bible had played in the development of his philosophical thinking. 



Use the mosaic image of of gospel writers to start telling the story of bible as book.

If we are going to talk about bible as interfAce and readers as users, how would we describe the 

We have seen how a Levinasian notion of proximity can shape our theory of interface. Levinas also helps us with a transition to bible as interface in his reflections on the way bible shaped his own philosophical thinking. One of the wonderful things about Levinas is the way in which his writings and thinking on Judaism are so entangled with his philosophical explorations. 

I have suggested interface as a space that demands difference and proximity as a way of imagining this demand as an anarchic relationship that can not be reduced to mastery. Levinas, in his own reflections on bible, finds this proximate interface there. 

** Maybe in this chapter I could just layout the different user encounters with different bible interfaces to demonstrate the usefulness of bible as interface. So, user interface in roll, user interface in codex, and user interface with bible in medieval times, maybe to Luther. Even further to bielo on words upon the word and contemporary bible studies.

Then move to bible as anarchic interface. - maybe not, I wonder if actually, chapter 3 could be simply the articulation of bible as interface (multilayered as I have argued). Then chapter 4 could use anarchy as one affordance to look for accross material mediations of bible, much like Hayles does with literary hypertext in Print is Flat? So, the structure of chapter 3 would be:

- Book of Books
- Bible as Book
-- archic bible and a focus on WHAT is in the container
- Bible as interface
-- material focus on use and 

The conversation continues toward questions about the relationship between bible, philosophical writings and the Russian literary classics. At one point, Nemo asks Levinas about the ways he has 'harmonized' biblical and philosophical thinking, to which Levinas responds:

What we will find is that bible and the process of reading it encourages, provides an interface with religion, thus with the face of the other. The bookishness he mentions in his initial response to Nemo about where thinking begins now gets wrapped into what Levinas calls 'the religious sentiment.' We have to remember here that Levinas often uses words in ways that are unfamiliar. Curiously, I have been working with this passage for several years and it wasn't until just recently that the role of religion gained amplitude. My contentious background as an evangelically trained biblical exegete always drew me toward his correlation of mystery, possibility, exegesis, and transcendence in the underlined section above. I hadn't even taken the time to consider this response as an articulation of Levinas's theory of religion, or at least a statement about the practices that stimulated his religious imagination.

Spending so much of my time thinking about the role of book technologies in religious identity, I have often missed the importance of the '*relationship with* books' in this discussion of bible. If we follow this passage further, we find this *relationship* with books restated in the commentators, the hermeneutic glimpsing, and the place of interpretation. We find here hints toward bible as exceeding any reduction to container, bible as relationship with, bible as a proximate interface. But let us take a closer look at the relationship of bible and book. 

Should I put a version of my paper from MJP class here?? I need to look.

Maybe even note here that this notion of bible
Is Jewish and not how I read the Christian notion of bible throughout most of history. Levinas offers bible as anarchic and xian history is archic.


The Greek word used most often for this roll book is biblon. So, as I said before, before bible became Bible, it was book.

I need to say something here about my choice of a Jewish thinker to introduce a chapter on bible when I am headed in a direction of a more focused critique of Christian notions of bible as archic. Seems to fit here because the rise of the codex is not taken up by Non-Jesus Jews in the same way it is taken up by Jesus Jews. Perhaps here I return to my musing about the tablets as bible? Either way, I at least need to admit in a note that I have a hunch that Jewish notions of bible don't perform the same archic tendencies that we find in the Christian tradition. Of course, theses traditions are both polyvalent and have a wide range of expressions of bible. Our look at the Talmudic page in chapter 4 will point to some material manifestations of this hunch I have. For now, I will focus on a Christian concept of bible that is deeply embedded in codex as a form and arche as a disposition. 

This would be mostly the Roberts and skeat stuff and turner and some specific book history work on the emergence of the codex.
- find some non bible focused works recently on history of book and see how they trace transition of dominance from roll to codex. 

### the Christian book ###
Begin here with the image of the mosaics of the gospel writers in Ravenna, with a basket of rolls And a codex on the desk. The New Testament writings were not simply a theological translation of Jewish writings, they were also a material media translation of the notion of scripture from roll to codex. 

I provide this long introduction to affordance theory as a way toward imagining the proximity of the face in Levinas as an interface which affords anarchy. First, we need to consider the possibility of proximity as interface, a zone of encounter that provokes probabilistic production. 
I wonder if I should go back to introducing affordances here as a way to look at the relationship of user with interface, a relationship which also constitutes the process of interface.
