We have now considered interface as a way of thinking about our relationship with books. We have articulated a multilayered theory of interface based on Levinasian proximity that accounts for the entangled interfaces of human-machines-human. Now, we can turn to bible and explore how this proximate theory of interface might help us imagine bible as interface. Why focus on bible as interface here and not some other literary tradition that has had a lasting impact on culture? One of the reasons I ever began considering proximity as a way of describing our relationship with bible was due to a moment in Philip Nemo's interviews with Levinas that hinted at the deep role bible had played in the development of his philosophical thinking. 


** Maybe Add some bits from Johnson on bookrolls and scribes at Oxyrhyncus and Bagnall 2009 on books and readers in Eqypt.

Sinaiticus is the oldest known manuscript of the "complete" New Testament as it is known today and a large portion of the Septuagint, the Hebrew Bible in Greek.  As I noted above in the general description of codex as interface, manuscripts at this time still lacked most of the reference markers with which we have become so familiar today. So, Codex Sinaiticus most definitely demonstrates the affordance of non-linear access, because any of the writings in this vast collection in one volume could be accessed immediately, without having to process through each column of text to get there, either backward or forward. Yet, we see no evidence of expanded capacities for non-linear access as would be provided by page numbers, chapter and verse markings, indexes, etc.

perhaps could we even suggest the EUsebian apparatus as a collaborative capacity between the voices of the text?

Using books in the constant context of a library is not entirely foreign to codex interfaces, because particularly in antiquity, many people only had access to books through libraries.^[Cite some mentions of rare private book use and the role of libraries in antiquity.] Yet, 

This new requirement for access to texts, ensuring that there is an adequate software layer to interpret the encoding of a particular textual interface has become a major concern in archival and preservation movements in the digital humanities.^[Provide a few examples of this conversation in library science and DH circles to highlight the complexity of the issue.]

Though a roll or codex has many components to its interface, such as covers, paper material, and ink color, these all combine to make a stable and singular material platform that is not heavily impacted by the user's participation in the interface accept through damage and wear. A major shift as we move to interfaces that involve internet and mobile technologies is a vast increase in user participation in constructing and selecting the material properties of the bible platform.

On my MacBook, I am working with a 12 inch diagonal screen and keyboard and trackpad as my primary contact with the reader application and the bible. To use this kindle bible on my MacBook, I open up my web browser of choice, which is Safari in this case, and I type in the web address read.amazon.com. This website prompts me for a username and password, perhaps similar to the lock and key we see on some ancient manuscripts. Once I have verified my identity with the reader application layer of this interface, I am presented with a view of my entire library that I have purchased from Amazon, the maker of the Kindle reader platform.^[Though the economic and social relationship between Amazon and the producers of the particular books that are available in kindle offers another interesting aspect to these new media interfaces, I will leave that discussion to others.]

Once I choose *The Bible: The Holy Bible Formatted for Your eReader* from the the kindle library view by clicking on its cover, the bible takes up the entire space of the browser page. Again, with the distinct emphasis on use in this bible, the first "page" offered to the user is titled "How to most effectively use this Bible on your Kindle." This introductory material is framed as a frequently asked questions page, which is a common feature of many online technological interfaces and communicates a focus on users of the platform. As we saw in the marketing of this bible, all of the FAQs have to do with navigation and the affordances for non-linear access possible in this interface, very little mention of the specifics of the content or the composition of the texts accessed in this interface. After this short introduction on use, there is nothing further in terms of front matter besides the linked table of contents, which provides one of the material media translations of non-linear access from earlier forms of codex. Instead of providing a list of content items with their respective starting page numbers that a user can use to thumb through the book to locate a particular content set, the beginning of each content unit is linked in this table of contents so a user can simply click and be taken to that location in the bible. The Kindle layer of the interface allows the user to return to the table of contents from anywhere in the bible if needed. 

Although bible has had a reference and location system otherwise than the page since chapter and verse markings were introduced into print editions in the 16th century,^[Cite a few sources on this.] this increased participation in user construction of the page still offers new reading affordances that were not available in earlier interfaces, such as limiting the amount of text on a page or changing the number of times a user had to enact a page turn to get through a particular portion of the bible.

Throughout this discussion of the kindle bible interface thus far, I have consistently put the word "page" in quotes to indicate that though the construct of the page is entirely operative in the kindle book, 

### collectability and anarchy

When I use this kindle bible, I am always also carrying around my entire library. Here we see an expansion of the portability and collectability affordances often associated with the codex. Though Codex Sinaiticus was too massive to provide much portability, its , The kindle interface not only allows me to carry around the bible in my pocket or my book bag (pun intended), but my entire library. Though the kindle interface does not yet provide a global search across the content of all items in the library, you can imagine the increased affordance of intertextual engagement as I can move from bible to *Dubliners* in the seconds it takes to make two clicks. The lack of searchability across books is one of the reasons I still consider kindle as a book platform, performing codex in a digital space. Once an interface begins to push beyond the boundedness of a codex, we are moving toward something beyond book. This library affordance provided by the kindle platform strikes me in some ways as analogous to the ways Timothy Beal has spoken of bible itself as more of a library than a book. In his book, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, which happens to be in my kindle library, Beal wonderfully points out that bible resists some of the univocal sensibilities of the codex because it is a collection of multiple voices from multiple contexts and time periods dealing with a plurality of cultural and historical issues.^[Beal, *Rise and Fall, ??]. So, even before the rise of pocket storage devices that can provide participation in thousands of books at the tap of a finger or simple voice command, bible as codex was already demonstrating the affordance of collection provided by a library and the encounter with plurivocality and difference. This kind of collecting could provide some distance in an interface insofar as the different voices collected together challenge attempts to consolidate bible into a single unified voice. 


Use the mosaic image of of gospel writers to start telling the story of bible as book.

If we are going to talk about bible as interfAce and readers as users, how would we describe the 

We have seen how a Levinasian notion of proximity can shape our theory of interface. Levinas also helps us with a transition to bible as interface in his reflections on the way bible shaped his own philosophical thinking. One of the wonderful things about Levinas is the way in which his writings and thinking on Judaism are so entangled with his philosophical explorations. 

I have suggested interface as a space that demands difference and proximity as a way of imagining this demand as an anarchic relationship that can not be reduced to mastery. Levinas, in his own reflections on bible, finds this proximate interface there. 

** Maybe in this chapter I could just layout the different user encounters with different bible interfaces to demonstrate the usefulness of bible as interface. So, user interface in roll, user interface in codex, and user interface with bible in medieval times, maybe to Luther. Even further to bielo on words upon the word and contemporary bible studies.

Then move to bible as anarchic interface. - maybe not, I wonder if actually, chapter 3 could be simply the articulation of bible as interface (multilayered as I have argued). Then chapter 4 could use anarchy as one affordance to look for accross material mediations of bible, much like Hayles does with literary hypertext in Print is Flat? So, the structure of chapter 3 would be:

- Book of Books
- Bible as Book
-- archic bible and a focus on WHAT is in the container
- Bible as interface
-- material focus on use and 

The conversation continues toward questions about the relationship between bible, philosophical writings and the Russian literary classics. At one point, Nemo asks Levinas about the ways he has 'harmonized' biblical and philosophical thinking, to which Levinas responds:

What we will find is that bible and the process of reading it encourages, provides an interface with religion, thus with the face of the other. The bookishness he mentions in his initial response to Nemo about where thinking begins now gets wrapped into what Levinas calls 'the religious sentiment.' We have to remember here that Levinas often uses words in ways that are unfamiliar. Curiously, I have been working with this passage for several years and it wasn't until just recently that the role of religion gained amplitude. My contentious background as an evangelically trained biblical exegete always drew me toward his correlation of mystery, possibility, exegesis, and transcendence in the underlined section above. I hadn't even taken the time to consider this response as an articulation of Levinas's theory of religion, or at least a statement about the practices that stimulated his religious imagination.

Spending so much of my time thinking about the role of book technologies in religious identity, I have often missed the importance of the '*relationship with* books' in this discussion of bible. If we follow this passage further, we find this *relationship* with books restated in the commentators, the hermeneutic glimpsing, and the place of interpretation. We find here hints toward bible as exceeding any reduction to container, bible as relationship with, bible as a proximate interface. But let us take a closer look at the relationship of bible and book. 

Should I put a version of my paper from MJP class here?? I need to look.

Maybe even note here that this notion of bible
Is Jewish and not how I read the Christian notion of bible throughout most of history. Levinas offers bible as anarchic and xian history is archic.


The Greek word used most often for this roll book is biblon. So, as I said before, before bible became Bible, it was book.

I need to say something here about my choice of a Jewish thinker to introduce a chapter on bible when I am headed in a direction of a more focused critique of Christian notions of bible as archic. Seems to fit here because the rise of the codex is not taken up by Non-Jesus Jews in the same way it is taken up by Jesus Jews. Perhaps here I return to my musing about the tablets as bible? Either way, I at least need to admit in a note that I have a hunch that Jewish notions of bible don't perform the same archic tendencies that we find in the Christian tradition. Of course, theses traditions are both polyvalent and have a wide range of expressions of bible. Our look at the Talmudic page in chapter 4 will point to some material manifestations of this hunch I have. For now, I will focus on a Christian concept of bible that is deeply embedded in codex as a form and arche as a disposition. 

This would be mostly the Roberts and skeat stuff and turner and some specific book history work on the emergence of the codex.
- find some non bible focused works recently on history of book and see how they trace transition of dominance from roll to codex. 

### the Christian book ###
Begin here with the image of the mosaics of the gospel writers in Ravenna, with a basket of rolls And a codex on the desk. The New Testament writings were not simply a theological translation of Jewish writings, they were also a material media translation of the notion of scripture from roll to codex. 

I provide this long introduction to affordance theory as a way toward imagining the proximity of the face in Levinas as an interface which affords anarchy. First, we need to consider the possibility of proximity as interface, a zone of encounter that provokes probabilistic production. 
I wonder if I should go back to introducing affordances here as a way to look at the relationship of user with interface, a relationship which also constitutes the process of interface. 

Gaver extends Norman's use of affordances into 3 categories, perceived, hidden and false (Gaver 1991). Though Gaver seems to move back toward affordances as properties rather than relationships, he does offer some insights into using affordances to evaluate the suitability of interfaces, which may help us later on as we use N. Katherine Hayles's media specific analysis to evaluate a few interfaces and their affordance of anarchy or lack thereof. FINISH THIS STRAND...

** Add here both Eusebian canons and Hexapla as new interfaces based on the emergence of codex as a technology. 

** Also add here a paragraph on print as basically an extension and consolidation of codex as an interface. No doubt print offered new affordances as an interface, but we can look at these affordances as expansions of the codex that may have shaped even deeper dispositions toward fixicity, stability and comprehensiveness/totality. In fact, I could mention Tim's definition of bible as cultural icon here as a product of print affordances. 

Here, I'll need to push at least until the Eusebius requested codex bibles of the 4th-5th century. But start closer to my old argument about the intersecting demands of portability, authority, and usefulness as a way of imagining the rise of this medium for book in Christian scripture. 
- again, when do we see this bound collection of scriptural writings referred to as a whole as bible?
- key here is to demonstrate that bible is bound to book (use Tim here and then follow his argument into another media transition. 

I think I will drop the defining bible section and merely begin here, with bible as book. Part of me wants to push all the way back to tablets as bible, but may have to save that for a note somewhere. Instead, here, I will use kugel and others who have traced the history of bible and begin with the biblos in Paul's writings, perhaps. 
- I'd like to know where biblos occurs in LXX and In What contexts
- I'd like to know when/how Jewish scriptures get called bible
- refer to rise of codex business and role of bible from intro 

Will have to at least mention hurtado here and perhaps I can compare his stats with those of Roberts and skeat, etc.

## Archic Bible

One of the arguments I am promoting here is that a move to consider bible as interface can encourage concepts and practices around books like bible that are anarchic. As I mentioned when introducing anarchy in the last chapter, the tradition of bible had been deeply infused with archic tendencies along the way. 
As indicated by the inerrancy statement, these central texts at the *beginning*
of core biblical writings have shaped biblical interpretation and bible reading 
practices. We can see the influence of this arche on bible reading practices
throughout history and here some examples of archic approaches to bible 

- reformation - return to original languages
- principles guiding the construction of the Nestle-Aland
- Jesus Seminar
- would be interesting to explore the Buber rosenzwrig translation as a problematization of this arche binary. They did promote a return to an original as the governing principle, but this return was to speech and sound. Here again we have a levinasian theme emerge around the difference between speech and both writing and seeing. In his Jewish sensibility sound has a way of eluding mastery that is much more difficult with sight and words.


### Apostolicity in Canon Discussions

Though our awareness of the complicated history of canon consciousness is growing, one place we can see the reign of an original in the production of bible is in the conversations around acceptable scriptures and canon in early Christian communities.[^Recall my brief explanation of the difference between scripture and bible as I use them here. Scripture is a broader category that denotes a writing that is deemed authoritative for a particular religious community (Wimbush 2008 - Theorizing Scriptures, ??). Bible is a specific expression of scripture by Judeo-Christians traditions and denotes a collection of authoritative writings in a book for use by a particular community.] As noted in other places, I am more interested here in the *process* of evaluation of writings that should or should not be considered as bible than in any final or definitive product. One of the common criteria we find used by early Christian church communities to decide whether to consider a writing as scripture is apostolicity. 

For a writing to be apostolic, it had to be written by an apostle or by a near associate of an apostle. For example, in his 39th Festal Letter in the year 362, often considered the earliest full list of the 27 New Testament writings as we have them in contemporary versions of bible, Athanasius follows the archaeological historical method of the Gospel according to Luke and says, 
> It being my intention to mention these matters, I shall, for the commendation of my venture, follow the example of the evangelist Luke and say [cf. Luke 1:1-4]: Since some have taken in hand to set in order for themselves the so-called apocrypha and to mingle them with the God-inspired scripture, concerning which we have attained to a sure persuasion, according to what the original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers, I also, having been urged by true brethren and having investigated the matter from the beginning, have decided to set forth in order the writings that have been put in the canon, that have been handed down and confirmed as divine, in order that every one who has been led astray may condemn his seducers, and that every one who has remained stainless may rejoice, being again reminded of that (Cite traditional translation).
There are two archic moments worth mentioning in this early witness to the discussions around writings deemed "God-inspired scripture." Athanasius sets up his listing as that which is handed down from the "original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers." This is a direct statement of the apostolic criterion, writings which originate from the direct teaching of Jesus through the authorship of original eye-witnesses. There is a positive correlation in this tradition between the arche and logos of John 1:1 and the impulse to use the origin of Jesus's words passed down through his apostles as a governing criteria for deciding what constitutes bible. The second archic moment is found in the statement of historical method borrowed from the Gospel according to Luke, "Having investigated the matter from the beginning." Here again we find recourse to a beginning or origin as the governing principle for determining what is meaningful. 

Now, as Harry Gamble and Lee Martin McDonald have highlighted, the canonization process is and has always been complicated and the archic impulse of the criterion of apostolicity was not sufficient alone for consideration nor was it the only variable operative in these conversations (Gamble 1985, ; McDonald 2002, ). Yet, some of the other criteria also lend themselves to the archic impulse, governed by an origin or a singular principle, such as antiquity (earliest writings) and orthodoxy (fits accepted principles of faith).

Interestingly, the majority of writings considered for this category come from the first or second century of the common era (criteria of antiquity) and have no internal identification of authorship at all, they are anonymous or even pseudepigraphic.[^List here the writings that have textual authorial identification, those that do not, and those considered pseudepigraphic with a citation for more info on pseudepigraphy.] Thus, considerations of authorship by early Christian communities were based on passed down tradition about the origin of these writings as much as the writings themselves.

## reimagining bible ##

Taking a very different approach, Tim Beal in *The Rise and Fall of the Bible*, also raises some questions that challenge the cultural notions of bible and book. Driven in part by a curiosity around the continued rise in bible production and sales alongside what seems to be a decline in biblical literacy in America (QUOTE), Beal questions our typical ingrained notions of the relationship between literary production and consumption. He suggests that the meaning and value of the bible in America may have little to do with the accessibility and relevance of the texts inside these books that carry on the ancient manuscript tradition. Instead, it is the cultural iconicity of the bible that generates its value and meaning. Perhaps this cultural iconicity is akin to the reality principle that Baudrillard talks about in Disneyland? People buy bibles not because they actually think they will find some original meaning in these ancient texts that will be relevant to their contemporary life, but because the cultural idea of bible offers a promise that "truth" or "reality" still exist. 

No doubt, Beal is on to something when he suggests that this cultural idea of bible as a locus of singular and univocal truth is bound up in the codex technologies that came to hold in one volume the entire libraries that constituted the various community collections that were called scrolls but came to be know as bible (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location, 2032-46). In so far as this cultural idea of bible prevails, the bible as stable truth or "the real," the cultural value of the bible is married to the the cultural vlaue placed on the codex. Yet, the codex is losing its grip on the reality principle with the advent of e-books, cloud collections, and searchability that gives us new "books" made up of fragments from many sources and with little regard for their location in their "original" narratives. How will the cultural iconicity of the bible fare in this new marketplace?

Like Parker, Beal too problematizes the dominant conception of the bible as a singular book with a stable original. Interestingly, both authors make this argument using the cultural capital valued in the bible context, antiquity, which can easily slide into a sense of recovering an original. Nonetheless, Beal describes the early manuscript tradition of the bible as a collection of texts from many sources and many contexts that "were not the same from copy to copy. There was no beginning and no end to them, no first and last page. They did not have one author or one voice. They were not read in a linear way, but they were read around in. And they grew through interpretation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2046). Beal offers this imagination of the bible as a multivocal, polyvalent and dynamic library to challenge the doxa of the bible as "the literal Word of God and closed book of answers" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2032). Just before this quote, Beal suggests that this cultural imagination of bible as reality principle is already dead, so he goes on to articulate an alternative imagination of the bible as "a space that hosts accidental revelation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location 2060), an infinite cycle of production littered with intrigue and surprise as meaning is made in practice.

Some more specifics on book in particular and the growing cultural transition of book beyond the medium of codex.

## Bible as Interface

In this time of media transition for book, thus for bible as well, our theory of interface embedded in a framework of proximity as the increase of both nearness and distance paves a way for bible to transform along with the cultural artifact that gave it its name. 
Interface is this space of 'relationship with.' It is the relationship with books, the discourse of reading, that constitutes the religious sentiment for Levinas, not only the books themselves.

## What is Bible? ##

Walk through concept of bible here from Greek word for scroll to early concepts of Judeo-Christian scripture to Tim Beal's bible as cultural icon.  In one sense, bible is a collection of writings that function as scripture for a Jewish of Christian community. Scripture denotes, in this case, a writing that has significant religious value for a community. Religious values are... 

Taking seriously the material scripture movement, I will talk more narrowly about bible as a material artifact that is utterly bound up in books, as Levinas so nicely suggests for us above. 



## Anarchic bible ##

I wonder if the technological affordance of non linear access offered by the codex itself was already a hint in the direction of anarchy? Materially, the roll depended on the beginning and the end of a text and a particular directionality of access. With the advent of the codex, the role of the beginning of a text needn't play the same grounding role, technologically. This could provide a concrete material illustration of the kind of anarchy I am espousing. A codex most definitely still has a beginning, yet the beginning need no longer govern the reading experience, since a reader can enter into the text at any point.

Maybe I end this section with a nod to the fact that proximity was possible in roll interface without recourse to content?? So, maybe the Great Isaiah Scroll is bible as much because it affords proximity in interface as it is bible because it contains a particular text. 

This reading of scripture in the synagogue of Luke 4 portrays the use of this roll interface for bible. If we read the 2nd letter to Timothy attributed to Paul the apostle, we see an explicit mention of his use of rolls as Timothy is asked to bring the rolls (biblia), especially the parchments. Vast material manuscript evidence from Qumran and Cairo Geniza and Oxyryncus all provide examples of bible as roll. What relationship with text might this roll offer users of bible? The linear access to text offers a spatial sense of where each portion of text is in relationship to the whole. In fact, a user has to physically pass through the whole to get to any part and the rolls in each hand get bigger and smaller, providing a visual cue as to how close a user is to one end or the other.^[Perhaps this interface influences the rabbinic exegetical notion of all parts must be read in relationship to the whole (WHAT IS THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THIS).] This does not mean that all of the content of bible had to be in one roll and it certainly was not at this stage of development. We have evidence of bible rolls containing one single writing only, such as the Isaiah roll found at Qumran. Other bible rolls contain combinations of writings, such as the Torah scroll that contains the first five writings of the Hebrew scriptures together in one roll. Theoretically, the length of a roll was unbounded, allowing for endless collecting of writings in one interface. Yet, due to usability, it seems that roll lengths stayed limited to at most approximately ?? long. The two handed interface with rolls demanded some limits on scalability, which in turn led to selectivity in collecting writings together in a single interface. 

How might we talk about the Isaiah roll as an interface in ways that might exceed what we imagine when thinking about the Isaiah roll as a container. In fact, we can begin with the name, Isaiah roll. We tend to name these rolls and other book interfaces by the content they contain or even the assumed author of the text. In antiquity, this attribution of authorship is dubious at best given the common practice of pseudepigaphy.^[Give a citation or two for people to explore the role of ]What if we imagined the story told by the text of the roll as only one affordance of the interface that is
