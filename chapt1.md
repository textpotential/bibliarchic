Because books and reading have been so instrumental in the typical focus on exegesis and interpretation driving the study of religion and bible, it is helpful to have a different way to speak of the material practices that constitute the rich history of bible. Looking at bible in terms of users and interfaces instead of simply books and readers offers us four primary advantages. First, thinking of bible as interface rather than book can unsettle the unquestioned binding of bible and codex, which coincides with the dominant cultural reduction of book to codex. By looking back at the bible roll as an interface and forward to kindle reader as an interface for bible, we can imagine better what constitutes bible for users beyond our current limited conception of book. Second, a focus on bible as interface highlights the material affordances operative in different user relationships with bible that extend beyond typical modes of reading, such as annotation and illumination in margins, organizational schemes, and use of bible as artifact. Third, exploring bible as interface can challenge us to conceptualize bible through its use rather than reducing definitions of bible to the content it contains. Fourth, tracing moments in the history of bible as interface allows us to see the continuities and discontinuities involved in media transitions/translations brought on by emerging technologies. One of the key things to remember as we explore the many interfaces of bible throughout history is that these interfaces all borrow from each other and technological transitions are never total.

## Why Interface? ##

As I mentioned in my introduction, one of the aims of this project is to focus our attention on the materiality of bible even beyond the book as we know it. This bent toward materiality stems from two main convictions that I bring to this work. First, I begin with the assumption that the material characteristics of the technologies we use shape our relationship with texts and with one another. Second, I affirm that the digital is decidedly material. A shift to talking about bible as interface foregrounds a user's interaction with the particular material technologies of bible and connects the pre-digital materialities of bible, such as roll and codex, to a participatory construct and language that is ubiquitous in digital environments today.

Brent Plate has helped promote the importance of materiality in the study and practice of religion. More specifically, Plate calls students and scholars[^students] of the study of religion to attend to the role of the senses in religion.[^senses] In his work with religion and the senses in *A History of religion in 5 1/2 objects*, Plate foregrounds the role and importance of material objects such as stones, drums, and bread by suggesting that "Religious people are not *believers* so much as *technologists*."[^believers] Rather than articulating a notion of religion absent of belief, Plate is simply suggesting that the *craft* of practicing religion entangled with material objects, what Plate calls "know-how" derived from the ancient Greek word *techne*, carries at least as much weight as what a religious person "knows" about what they are practicing.[^know-how] Plate hints toward the role of interface and users in religion when he defines technology as "human connections to and uses of natural and human-made materials... ."[^tech] Though Plate is using an ancient and broad definition of technology to highlight the importance of material objects and their use without pointing toward specific examples of interfaces that we might call technological today, he is setting the stage within the material religion discourse for a more particular technological analysis of bible. Just as Plate argues for religion as technology irreducible to belief, I am arguing for bible as interface irreducible to text.

[^students]: It is unfortunate that I can not simply say students of the study of religion here and have it obviously refer to scholars as well. Yet, perhaps this is pertinent to the difficulty of Plate's task in challenging the trends of reducing the study of religion to textual analysis. If scholarship has become more about production than about learning, what incentive does an established scholar of the study of religion have to experiment with new approaches? 
[^senses]: At several points in his book, *A History of Religion in 5 1/2 Objects*, Plate cleverly articulates his aim with the turn of phrase, "bringing the spiritual to its senses." See p. 19-22 for some examples.
[^believers]: Plate, *5 1/2 Objects*, 22. In a personal conversation with Jeffrey Mahan, he mentioned that in teaching Plate's methodologies, some students assume Plate is articulating a notion of religion that is absent of God or belief. I can see how this quote could be taken in such a binary or exclusionary fashion, even if not necessarily Plate's intention. For our purposes here, I will use language of religion as technology, which is irreducible to belief, in order to dethrone the role of belief in the study and practice of religion without a need to eradicate it as a part of religious phenomena. 
[^know-how]: Plate, *5 1/2 Objects*, 22.
[^tech]: Plate, *5 1/2 Objects*, 22. As Hutchings notes in "Augmented graves and virtual Bibles," 88, Plate's approach is closely connected to the physicality of the human senses and often doesn't explicitly deal with the materialities of the digital. With Hutchings, I am taking a more technical (pun intended) approach to technology than Plate by focusing on what we more readily imagine as technological platforms for accessing Judeo-Christian sacred texts through books, websites, mobile devices, and APIs. Yet, Plate signals his attention to the religious ramifications of the extended materialities of emerging technologies in his treatment of media in the skinscape of religion and his articulation of the soul as technology. In *5 1/2 Objects*, 23, Plate writes, "Religion in a high-tech, media-saturated, global-economic age is as reliant on objects as it is in smaller scale societies."

## Bible as Irreducible to Text ##

James Watts was one of the founding members of the Iconic Books Project, which gathered together scholars from several disciplines to explore the role of books in history, society, culture, and religion beyond simply the interpretation of their texts within. This project continues presently as "The Society for Comparative Research on Iconic and Performative Texts," incidentally, with Brent Plate as their current president.[^ib] Through his work with the Iconic Books Project, Watts has articulated three dimensions of scripture, the semantic, the performative, and the iconic. As the society name indicates, SCRIPT is decidedly focused on the non-semantic dimensions of books. 

[//]: something about the relationship between semantic and consumptive and performative and production. need to indicate that interface seems to hold together aspects of iconic and performative dimensions, but decidedly dethroning the semantic. 

[//]: I think my notion of interface, built upon Drucker's provoking probabilistic production, actually combines both the iconic and performative dimensions.

--Similarly, bible readers are not just interpreters, they are users that produce bible through their relationship with the material technologies of their scriptures. Plate goes even further in "The Skin of Religion" suggesting that religion is grounded in a "skinscape" which operates as a space of encounter between human senses and the objects of the physical world. Here, Plate is participating in Manuel Vasquez's challenge of the textualism, the focus on the interpretation of texts, that has dominated the study of religion and biblical studies at the expense of a careful attention to the role of the senses in relationship to the material objects of the world as constituting the theory and practice of religion. Here, I am extending Plate's notion of skinscape in the study of religion to an emphasis on the materiality of bible as interface, a space of encounter that entangles user and platform in an emergent process of producing bible.

As watts notes in his three dimensions of scripture, much focus has been given to the semantic dimension of bible, how meaning is made through the interpretation of the words that constitute the content of bible. Bible as interface provides a framework for taking more seriously the iconic and performative dimensions of bible as scripture through the material structures that define bible and the uses afforded by bible as interface. Tracing bible as interface through several different time periods and technological instantiations also highlights the comparative and remediation foci of David Morgan's methodology of material analysis in the study of religion. Morgan articulates nine foci in three areas that can facilitate the academic study of religion through material objects and our interaction with them. 

My suggestion that we think of bible as an interface has two main aims. First, bible as interface can challenge ideas and practices that reduce bible to simply a container of content to be consumed and can guide our imagination of bible in a time of major media transition. Second, an interface that resists our recourse to an original text or singular governing principle in the act of reading can help focus us on the vast productive potentialities of this interface even as it is translated into media technologies we have yet to imagine. This first chapter will focus on the first of these aims by advocating for a concept^[Might add a note here from Piotr about the preference for concept over definition.] of interface as a space and a process that facilitate relationship without eradicating difference. 

## Defining Interface ##

At its most basic, interface denotes some kind of relationship of interaction between entities. With this generic definition, we can imagine countless examples in everyday life, such as the the relationship of interaction between my son and his dog, or the relationship between neurotransmitters and receptors in a chemical synapse in your brain, or the relationship between my fingers and the beautifully designed butterfly keyboard I am using right now to type this sentence. Though I find a great deal of beauty in the ubiquitous relationality this broad imagination of interface offers, we will need a narrower definition of interface as we consider the relationship between bible and users. Even a quick glance at a dictionary entry for "interface" will highlight its relationaility and its importance in the realm of technology. 

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has entries for "interface" as both a noun and a verb. Interestingly, both noun and verb entries in the OED figure Marshall McLuhan, of "medium is the message" fame, prominently as the first quotation in the non-scientific definitions of the term. In fact, the OED credits McLuhan as the first user of "interface" in the verbal form in a 1967 collaborative effort with Quentin Fiore (McLuhan and Fiore 1967). This discussion of the OED may seem superfluous, given that I will not be using definitions from the OED as a starting point to form my own definitions. Yet, the OED provides both a historical backdrop for the term and academic credibility for the categories of the term's use. In both parts of speech, the google search define algorithm and the freely available Oxford Dictionaries online include a specific definition related to computing for interface, which signals that the term has taken on special significance in the area of technology.[^googledef] 

[^googledef]: If I were working with a medium other than print here, I would embed the results from my google search for "define 'interface.'" The google search algorithm for definitions draws on many sources to provide a quick look at the main definitions of a term, its etymology, its frequency over time, and gives you the ability to translate the term into other languages. Due to the demands and customs of the print genre and related citation tendencies, I have chosen to reference a combination of OED and other useful definitions, particularly because the OED entries for this term are vastly outdated. Given my experience with this particular word, "interface," I can't help but question the subtitle of the OED online, which is "The definitive record of the English language." The google define algorithm results for "interface" can be found by running a google search on "define interface" and the Oxford Dictionaries Online free version entry can be found at https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface.

The first noun definition in the OED is the scientific definition, which denotes the boundary between two portions or phases of matter.^["interface, n.". OED Online. December 2016. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com.du.idm.oclc.org/view/Entry/97747?isAdvanced=false&result=1&rskey=QjGVLf& (accessed December 21, 2016).] Though this earliest use of the term is not our primary focus here, it is worth noting that even this scientific definition foregrounds difference as a necessary property of interface. Whether the interface identifies a boundary surface (the OED actually uses the term "face" here) within the same substance or between substances, the interface signals the place (or space) at which different entities interact. So, even in these early technical uses of the idea of interface in the late nineteenth century, we can hear the relationality and the difference at work in interface. A simple example like water in a pond shows the significance of a shift from speaking of just the surface of water to talking about the water/air interface. If we speak of just the surface of water, we focus only on the properties of water and its contained self relationality. Introducing the notion of interface here highlights the *relationship* water has with air, a *different* entity, both participating in the production of what we call the surface of water. 

As I mentioned above, the basic definition of "interface" as a noun is "A point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact."^[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface] This basic definition also encompasses the historical scientific definition if we add substances to the list of things that can meet and interact. Even though we often see the word "between" used with "interface," such as "the interface between religion and science," the simple definition of interface I have quoted above highlights that interface is a "point" or space or surface of meeting. This space of meeting is mutually constructed by the contact of the differing systems. Interface, in this sense, is not necessarily a space "between" two systems, but the space created by the entangled "interaction" of two systems. Since our definition states that systems must meet *and* interact, contact alone is not sufficient for interface, there must be some interaction among the systems. Again, we can see the demand for both difference and relationality in this idea of interface as space. 

These values of difference and relationality are maintained in the computing focused definition of interface, which is "A device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer"^[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface] or "a device or program for connecting two items of hardware or software so that they can be operated jointly or communicate with each other."^[google "define interface"] Here we see that interface has become a technical term in the technological realm to describe the piece of technology that is needed to allow two systems to meet and interact. Taking both the general definition and the computing definition together, we get something like interface enables interface. This computer interface is a thing that helps create the space for meeting and interacting between user and machine or machine and machine, a translation layer of sorts. 

Because of the difference between the modes of communication of a user, let's assume a human user, and a machine, an "interface" is needed to allow interaction. Here in the computing definition of interface, we find the noun and verb operations of interface coming together, a space of meeting and entanglement that facilitates interaction, even communication. The verbal definitions of interface are simply this, "to interact with" or "to connect with."[^verb] We have seen a movement from interface as boundary of separation indicating difference in the early scientific uses of the term to the more explicitly active connecting and communicating aspects of interface in the computing world. The operation of interface in this connection or communication between user and machine allows for a relationship between these entities without reducing their distinctions. 

[^verb]: Link to the Oxford Online Dictionaries. The simplicity of these verbal forms and my brevity in addressing them are not indicative of the importance I place on the verbal aspect of interface. In fact, I concur here with Johanna Drucker, that the more interesting manifestation of interface is in its verbal character -- event more than entity (Drucker 2011, ??). Yet, our difficult task here is to explore bible as interface without reducing interface to any one of these definitions at the expense of the other. Interface is a space that fosters a process of interaction that foregrounds the values of difference and relationality. 

## Interface as Event ##

Johanna Drucker's work draws our attention to the verbal character of interface. She  argues that texts are events not entities and that interface is a zone of encounter not a window through which we access content (Drucker 2009; Drucker 2011). It was Drucker's essay, "Humanities Approaches to Interface Theory," that first led me to consider the notion of bible as interface (2011). Drucker helpfully intertwines digital media studies explorations of interface design with humanities questions of subjectivity to provide a theoretical foundation for interface as a zone of encounter. In an exemplary fashion, Drucker demonstrates a reflexive practice by stating her desire to explore the theory undergirding her own scholarly working environments at the cusp of a transition from print to other dominant media/interfaces. She writes,  

> The motivation here is simple. The authoring and reading environments for interpretative scholarly work are only just beginning to be designed in such a way that the linear, finite conventions of print media can be changed for the constellationary, distributed, multi-faceted modes of digital media...As this process develops, a challenge for humanists is to reflect on and articulate the theory of interface that underlies the design of our working environments (Drucker 2011, 2).

Drucker shows her awareness of the shifts at work in the emerging digital media age and asks humanists to become a part of the process of constructing a theory to support the design of our reading and writing spaces as a counter balance to the often mechanistic principles at work in the software industry.[^26] The mechanistic approaches to both design and to the user in the software world, which is a progression of the development of the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and the growing economic importance of Graphical User Interface (GUI), tends to over determine the relationship between machine and user such that the ambiguity (another way of saying probability) of interaction is ignored (Drucker 2011, 1). Drucker challenges this tendency toward functional determinism by connecting her idea of text as event with interface as a zone of encounter. Pointing back toward her work on texts as event, Drucker suggests that "attention to the specific relations between properties and affordances of electronic environments within a system of codependent relations of production [with subjects] will be the starting point for assumptions about interface as a space that supports interpretative events and acts of meaning production" (Drucker 2011, 3). Critiquing the "window" metaphor that is so prevalent in our understanding of interface, Drucker pushes us to imagine interface as an event, both a thing *and* a process, both noun and verb as we saw in our exploration of definitions above (2011, 9). Drucker's binary rhetoric of entity to event might suggest that she devalues the materiality or thingness or noun character of interface in order to highlight the productive process at work in event. Yet, if we look closely at her concept of event in "Entity to Event" (2009, 8), we get a more material sense of what she is doing with interface as "not a thing" in "Humanities Approaches to Interface Theory" (Drucker 2011, 7-8). Drucker writes, "Probabilistic materiality conceives of a text as an event, rather than an entity. The event is the entire system of reader, aesthetic object and interpretation" (2009, 8). Here, event is the entire system, it entails entity without being reducible to it. Event contains both the material conditions of the participants and the process of their interaction. This concept of interface as event, which includes both the noun and verb characteristics of interface, resonates with the theory of space operative in Edward Soja's idea of thirdspace and the corresponding process of inquiry he calls thirding. 

## Interface as Space ##

The spatiality of Drucker's concept of interface is highlighted in her use of graphical reading practices and frame analysis to build her theory of interface as zone of encounter (Drucker 2011, 3-8). If, as Drucker suggests, interface is a space of encounter, but something more than simply a space between, then we can imagine resonances between Drucker's interface theory and Edward Soja's theory of space. Soja begins his introduction to *Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places* with a focus on participatory construction of space, saying, 

> We are becoming increasingly aware that we are, and always have been, intrinsically spatial beings, active participants in the social construction of our embracing spatialities. Perhaps more than ever before, a strategic awareness of this collectively created spatiality and its social consequences has become a vital part of making both theoretical and practical sense of our contemporary lifeworlds at all scales, from the most intimate to the most global (Soja 1996, 1).

This idea that we are "active participants in the social construction" of space echoes Drucker's focus on a constructivist subjectivity in her theory of interface. For both Soja and Drucker it is not simply that we together construct space but also that spaces construct us as we construct spaces. Soja's mention of "social consequences" here hearkens to Marshall McLuhan's famous adage that "the medium is the message." Though often misunderstood as reductionist or absolutist, McLuhan is simply suggesting that the message of any medium is its social effect, not the simply the content it contains (McLuhan 1964, 8).^[Perhaps it would have been more helpful to hold both directions of this famous apposition together such that medium is message and message is medium.] In the tradition of McLuhan, both Soja and Drucker emphasize that our materiality, which can be called media or can be called spatiality, has a significant impact on our sociality, even in digital environments. 

Combining Henri Lefebvre's "lived space" and Jorge Luis Borges's "Aleph", Soja articulates Thirdspace as a radical simultaneity where all spaces and all binaries come together (Soja 1996, 56-57). As Jacob Kinnard suggests in his preface to *Spaces in Motion*, Soja's notion of Thirdspace is "complex, slippery, and often frustrating" (Kinnard 2014, xv), so I will only attempt to draw the necessary connections between the possibilities of Thirdspace and my reflections on interface. Soja suggests that his notion of Thirdspace is closest to the third moment in Lefebvre's trialectic of social space, "lived space" (Soja 1996a, 68).^[Soja provides a discussion of Lefebvre's multiple names for this third moment in his trialectic as both "spaces of representation" and "lived space," but even at the cost of oversimplification, perhaps inevitable when trying to write or talk about these things, I will only use "lived space" (Soja 1996, 65).] This lived space of Lefebvre's is both separate from and the complex composite of the spatial practices (perceived space) and the conceptions of space (conceived space) that make up the other components of social spatiality (Soja 1996, 67-68). What is import for our theory of interface here is that space is a noun and a verb. Space in Soja's model is always a complex interaction among the materiality of spaces, our ideas of spaces, and the process of making meaning in these spaces, without the need to reduce space to any one of these constituent parts.^[I am beginning to wonder if the concept of place from thinkers like Cresswell and others might offer another useful metaphor for imagining interface. If place is space made meaningful, is this not what interface is all about? The reason I have stayed with space in this analysis is to foreground the materiality of this process of constructing all parties involved in interface.] Space as a system of interaction without reduction of difference sounds a great deal like interface as event in Drucker. This material and processual notion of space from Soja, provides a richer concept of interface as a *space* of relationship that supports difference.

An important part of Thirdspace that further supports our understanding of interface as space that enables difference is the methodology that undergirds even the articulation of Soja's model. The critical methodology at work in his notion of Thirdspace, Soja calls "Thirding-as-Othering," which is the mechanism by which his (and Lefebvre's) spatial analysis resists reduction to binarisms or dichotomies such as real/virtual, subject/object, or user/interface (Soja 1996, 60-61). As with the rest of his ideas in *Thirdspace*, Soja "approximates" this methodology of thirding-as-othering from Lefebvre's anti-reductionist approach described by the phrase "there is always an-Other."^[Add Fench in a footnote.] Soja's thirding provides a focus on space not as a simple combination of two forces, such as the social and the historical, but rather as a methodology that always attends to a third term that can emerge in the process of encounter. Soja writes, 

> Thirding introduces a critical 'other-than' choice that speaks and critiques through
its otherness. That is to say, it does not derive simply from an additive combination of its binary antecedents but rather from a disordering, deconstruction, and tentative reconstitution of their presumed totalization producing an open alternative that is both similar and strikingly different (Soja 1996, 61).

For example, a print book as a platform presents a set of constraints and possibilities on a reading event as does a particular reader sitting in an arm chair on a snowy Sunday afternoon. In this process of interface, thirding suggests that the combinatorial set of possibilities offered by the intersection of platform and user do not *determine* the productive potential of this interface. There is always an other possibility that can emerge in the process of encounter that can surprise or interrupt our expecations. It is this interruptive emergence and its insistence on resisting a closed system that thirding offers our theory of interface. Drucker's notion of interface as event or zone of encounter, with its constructivist approach, already challenges the mechanistic and determinative binaries of user and technological platform, encouraging a more spatial, material, and constructed notion of both media and the subject. Soja's Thirding-as-Othering, which practices an infinite preference for an alternative when faced with a binary choice, adds the property of emergence to our theory of interface (Soja 1996b, 1421). This explicit and intentional methodology of surfacing multiplicity and the possibility for unexpected newness when faced with a binary may not yet guide interface design or theory like it does Soja's cultural critique. Yet, Soja's Thirding-as-Othering provides us a disposition toward emergence, possibilities that arise in the process of interface that challenge established categories and resist closed analysis without a need to eradicate these categories. Interface as space of the thirding kind pushes the multiplicity Drucker encourages in her framing of interface toward a property of emergence in interface that will always overflow our analysis. Drucker says,

> Interface and its relation to reading has to be theorized as an environment in which varied behaviors of embodied and situated persons will be enabled differently according to its many affordances. That kind of statement is so maddeningly vague and abstract that it seems almost useless.[^36]

Drucker resists the strictly functional and mechanistic theories of interface design and asks humanists to imagine something more variable and responsive to the particularities of the people and the spaces involved. Interface as space, informed by the methodologies of Thirdspace and Thirding-as-Othering allows for the ambiguity Drucker finds missing in the software design process. The combinatorial particularities of platform and user do not produce the total set of possibilities for an interface, 'there is always an-Other.' Interface as space of the thirding kind can push beyond the simple intersection of two systems, book and reader, toward attending to processes that foster emergence and allow for difference. The emergent property of Soja's concept of space reinforces that interface is not simply the sum of the parts offered by platform and reader. Instead, in interface, something new is made; interface is event.  

## Book as Interface ##

We have moved from the mechanistic idea of interface as a thing through which we view data, to a constructivist interface as a zone of encounter that constitutes a space and a subject, finally to interface as a space of relationship that supports difference with a disposition toward interruptive emergence. The important strand that follows this trajectory is the continued challenge to any compartmentalization of what and how we read. Just as interface is not simply a thing we look through, a book is not just a container for content. A book is an invitation to an encounter of text and reader in the practice of reading and the materiality of this encounter has as much to tell us about meaning as the stories we read.

If we turn toward books and reading more specifically, 'Interface is *what we read* and *how we read* combined through engagement.’[^28] This is a critical point in the relationship of bible and/as media. If an interface involves both what we read and how we read, the design of the book technologies we use when reading shapes the reading performance and meaning made as much as the content. Reading bible in a codex is a different space than reading bible on an iPhone, thus, both the book and the reader are constituted differently in these two interfaces. This means that the transitions from scroll to codex and codex to internet are not simply new ways of reading the same content. Rather, bible and user are both transformed in the new space of encounter made possible by these different interfaces.

Another way to state the importance of interface in the reading process is to suggest that the structures of a particular book technology ARE information, not merely a means of access to information. This is another way of bothering the dichotomy between form and content or medium and message. In this interface as zone of encounter, medium and message are so inextricably entangled that attempting to tease them apart is futile. Drucker highlights this well, saying,

> A book is an interface, so is a newspaper page, a bathroom faucet, a car dashboard, an ATM machine. An interface is not so much a 'between' space as it is the mediating environment that makes the experience, a 'critical zone that constitutes a user experience'. I don't access 'data' through a web page; I access a web page that is structured so I can perform certain kinds of queries or searches. We know that the structure of an interface is information, not merely a means of access to it.[^29]

In this example, the "page"[^30] is not simply a window through which a user accesses data. Rather, the page is a part of the data and the data, in part, structures the page. So, with a codex, the space of the page is part of the data of the text, not simply a delivery mechanism. 

### Reader as User ###

Before we move on to look more closely at reading interfaces, I'd like to begin thinking of readers as users. As we saw in our exploration of definitions earlier, in computer interface, the two systems interacting are users and machines and the aim is a particular form of interaction, communication. Machine with machine interface is also important in computing, but since our focus here is on technologies of reading, I will only treat the user-machine interface for now.^[This immediately begs a question about the distinction between user and machine. With the rise of artificial intelligence, often machines are behaving in ways reserved traditionally for users, such as being readers of texts.] I find the role of users in the computing notion of interface wonderfully helpful for thinking about reading and bible, especially in times of technological transition, such as our current shift away from the dominance of print. We have deeply ingrained cultural notions of reading as a private exercise where a person picks up a book and reads silently over the pages. As an example of these unquestioned assumptions about reading, take Nicholas Carr's argument that the internet is making us dumber in *The Shallows* (2011). Carr does a wonderful job illustrating that our brains are more plastic than we may have imagined and that the technologies, even interfaces, we use impact the way our brains work (Carr 2011, ??). Yet, throughout Carr's argument for the detrimental effects of the internet on our brains, we find a narrow and romanticized notion of reading held up as the pinnacle of learning, thought, and meaning. Carr writes, 

> QUOTE the image of him sitting in his lawn chair reading the classics slowly, without other "distractions."

The contrast of this slow, isolated, contemplative relationship with a print codex is contrasted with the quicker, connected, and more fragmentary relationship we have with webpages on the internet and screens on a mobile device. Carr and I agree that these relationships, these reading interfaces, are different in significant ways. What seems to go unquestioned in Carr's analysis of our emerging reading trends is that reading and learning have not always been bound to the print codex and this is far from the first major transition in reading practices the world has seen.

In fact, it wasn't the internet that first awakened me to differences in reading practices. Even though the scarcity of silent reading in antiquity has been challenged, Harry Gamble's discussion of the aurality of reading in antiquity, particularly related to the common practice of *scriptio continua*, script without spaces or punctuation or other markers with which we are so familiar today, first interrupted my assumption that people have always read like we do today (Gamble 1995, 203-205).[^reading] More recently, William Johnson provides a useful analysis of the difference between reading in the bookroll culture of the Roman elite in the first two centuries of the common era and our modern reading practices (Johnson 2010). Johnson demonstrates that the difference in book technologies has a significant impact on the difference in book and reading culture, such that reading in antiquity had as much to do with oratory as it did the deciphering of letters (Johnson 2010, 29). I agree with Alberto Manguel in his *A History of Reading*, that there is something shared across time and space in this experience of reading, encountering the world and texts and making meaning out of them (Manguel 1996, 7). Reading is and has always been production. Yet, what is more pressing in our discussion here is the important relationship of difference between technologies and the reading practices they afford. Whether read predominantly silently or aloud, *scriptio continua* and bookrolls most definitely impacted the kind of interaction users had with texts. 

[^reading]: Gamble 1995, 321 n. 1 provides a helpful list of the classic sources arguing for the prevalence of audible reading in antiquity, including the most famous of the arguments made by Balough and the quote from Augustine that often gets used as evidence. Interestingly, Gamble includes in this list of sources an essay by Bernard M. W. Knox, which takes Balough to task and argues strongly against the conclusion that silent reading is exceedingly rare in antiquity. After a close reading of Balough's evidence and providing several additional texts that might speak to the issue, Knox concludes, "Ancient books were normally read aloud, but there is nothing to show that silent reading of books was anything extraordinary except the famous passage from Augustine's Confessions, and that is countered by the phrase of Cicero which makes sense only if understood as a reference to silent reading of lyric poets. As for letters and similar documents, Balogh's evidence is inadequate to start with and his case is blown sky-high by evidence he did not notice" (Knox 1968, 435).

Thus, given our narrow imagination of reading, due in part to the long reign of print, I prefer to talk about users instead of readers in our analysis of bible as interface. There are many reasons why I choose to interrupt our familiar notion of readers of bible. First, there are many uses of bible other than reading, such as ritual procession of bibles around a congregation, bibles as protective amulets, and bibles as decorative ornaments on a coffee table. Second, highlighting that readers are users and not the only users of bible reinforces the materiality of bible, both in the reading event and beyond. Emerging movements such as Material Religion, Institute for Signifying Scriptures, and SCRIPT have done a great deal to challenge the dominance of textuality in our conceptualization of both religion and scriptures. Redirecting our attention to bible users instead of simply bible readers is my attempt to support these movements and to keep our analysis embedded as much in the materiality of bible as in the cultural content it provides. Third, our emerging media age of mobile devices and the internet of things talks a great deal about the role of users in the production of interfaces. 

Consider the settings in my Kindle app that allow the user to determine the font size, page color, brightness, and other material aspects of the reading interface. Already, we can hear a subtle distinction here between reader as processor of the words in a book and user as participant in constructing the space that affords the reading event. In this case, the user is the reader, but also more. This shift toward more user participation in the construction of the space in which reader encounters text suggests a more complicated reading practice than we have been used to in print and hearkens back to our discussion of greater reader/orator participation demanded by *scriptio continua* in ancient bookrolls. Now, as an academic, I am well aware of much more active, material, and participatory reading practices in print than the basic caricature I portray here. For example the vast marginal notes and highlights offered by my committee members on early drafts of this very paragraph show an active and material participation in print. Yet, I would contend that this active participation in the space and process that is my dissertation pushes beyond our typical notions of what readers do. In this example, my committee members are using the interface of a paragraph to make something of their own, to add their own insights, to shape the space into something that fits their expectations and needs. This is reading, no doubt. But it pushes beyond reading to use. We can argue as to whether continuous script in a bookroll, chapter and section headings in a print codex, or variable page size in an electronic book reader produce more or less complicated reading environments. The hierarchical evaluation of these interfaces interests me less than their difference. My shift from reader to user is simply an attempt to tune our attention to these differences in relationship that constitute the interface that is reading. 

In her advocacy for humanistic approaches to interface design, Drucker suggests that the participants in interface are subject(s) and platform(s). Just as I have suggested a move from reader to user in our explorations of bible as interface, Drucker asks us to move from user to subject in our considerations of interface design. The backdrop of Drucker's call for a move from user to subject in the design of scholarly reading interfaces, is the discourse of software development, particularly the field know as HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) (Drucker 2011, 1). As you can tell by the name, HCI is the field that gave rise to what we have been calling the computing definition of interface, "A device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer."^[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface] Though Drucker does not often use the language of consumption explicitly, her frustration with the software industry's tendency to view the relationship between user and machine as efficient, mechanistic, and deterministic in the service of developing viable products for the market suggests a flat notion of user as viewer or simple consumer (Drucker 2011, 1). To counter these industry attempts to reduce ambiguity, Drucker calls for a reintroduction of the constructivist subject into our considerations of a theory of interface. I support both Drucker's rejection of the "mechanistic consumer-model of autonomous viewer" and her focus on the mutuality of platform and "subject" in constructing the space that is interface (Drucker 2011, 3). In a sense, my move from reader to user resonates with Drucker as an attempt to interrupt our reduction of reader to simple viewer or consumer of texts. 

So, both Drucker's move away from the term "user" and my embrace of the term here are attempts to resist a reduction to passive consumption by participants in the space and process that is interface. Though I support Drucker's call for a deeper involvement of humanities theories and theorists in the construction and theorization of interface, I will not follow her lead in using the language of subject to denote the human participants in reading interfaces for two reasons. First, a major reason for my choice of user instead of reader when discussing reading interfaces and bible as interface in particular, is to emphasize the materiality that constitutes the relationship between book and human. A return to the philosophical discourse of subject as the human participant in interface has the potential to obscure this materiality and lead us back toward an unbalanced focus on the human thought world as we theorize interface. Second, the subject/object binary is deeply ingrained in our theoretical sensibilities, even in the more nuanced notion of constructivist subject leveraged by Drucker, and I do not want to superimpose this binary onto our reflections on the relationships that emerge in the interaction of objects making up an interface. If we have to resort to subjective or objective language at all, I would prefer to speak of all participants in interface as objects.[^OOO] Keeping in mind Drucker's warnings about the overly mechanistic notions of "user" propagated by the software industry, we will stay with the term user as both an interruption in our overly familiar notions of reader and as a means of embracing the role of emerging technologies in our reading practices.  

[^OOO]: What if we leveled the playing field philosophically here and instead of leaning back toward the well trodden interplay of subject and object, even constructivist subject, in this space that is interface, we considered all participants as objects? One of the aims stated at the beginning of this chapter was to challenge the tendency toward an original text or a singular governing principle as the arbiter of meaning in the act of reading. If we rearticulate a subject as part of interface, how does this subject not become the singular governing principle? What if human participants in an interface are simply one type of object interacting with other objects to produce an event?  

### Spaces Provoking Probabilistic Production ###

Returning to our discussion of book as interface, near the end of her exhortation to humanities scholars to take seriously the task of building a theory of interface, Drucker reminds us that book has always been an interface.

> Though the coming of electronic media helped bring these observations into focus, the dynamic operations of the codex could already be described before the coming of hypertext, as we have seen. Clearly those with rich experience of book culture perceive the dynamic properties usually attributed to new media already active and present within the older forms, and rightly so. The book is no more self-identical, static, or fixed, than any other artifact that provokes a constitutive reading or response. Strict binarisms and technophilic exuberance lend themselves to exaggerated inaccuracies and hyperbolic rhetorical claims-charming in their own way, but perhaps not so useful for actual design. Many points of continuity exist between print and digitally networked artifacts and these don't have to depend on the seductive, special-effects, images of frictionless manipulation in holographic information spaces that will supposedly enable our lives in some fantasmatic future. Books, after all, are structured environments that provoke a reading that is probabilistic, not mechanistic, and the text or work is produced as an event, not an entity.[^38]

I quote Drucker here at length for two reasons. First, I have at times been prone to and accused of the charming 'strict binarisms and technophilic exuberance' Drucker cautions of here. Though I have found hyperbolic rhetoric useful at times to unsettle our unquestioned assumptions about media, I want to be exceedingly clear that, with Drucker, I am not interested in propagating some old/new hierarchical dichotomy between codex and emerging book technologies. This is why I introduced material media translation as a palimpsest at the outset of this project.^[Give a note to direct back to that part of introduction] Each emerging book technology is a translation of what came before it, a writing over that never fully replicates and only partially erases.

Second, this passage from Drucker begins and ends with a reminder that book has always been an interface. As the materiality of this interface shifts, we will undoubtedly learn from previous forms as we explore the affordances of emerging technologies. The last full sentence of this passage captures nicely the importance of understanding book as interface. To paraphrase in alliterative fashion, Drucker suggests that a book is an interface that *provokes probabilistic production* through the reading event.[^39] Let's look closely at each of these p-words in reverse order, production, probabilistic, and provokes.

**Production**

Reading is production. This may seem like an obvious statement, but it is important to remember that in any medium, a book is not simply a container of information to be ingested by a reader. The materialities and cultural contexts of both book and user entangle to produce the possibility for meaning in a reading act. Each encounter between book and user has the potential to offer something different, because reading is a production of meaning contingent upon the particularities of the encounter and its participants. If I read Emmanuel Levinas's *Otherwise than Being* in a hard bound print monograph as an undergraduate student in the early 2000's while sitting in the library at a small liberal arts college in Colorado, this will produce something different than my reading of the same text on a computer screen in a continuous scroll text editor as a late stage doctoral student in my house at the dawn of a Trump presidency. Though the "content" or the words of the text may remain identical in both of these cases, the readings simply can not remain the same. These two reading events are moments in the ongoing making that is my reading of *Otherwise Than Being*. In this sense, perhaps it would be more useful to talk about reading with a book rather than reading a book to help unsettle our typical notions of reading as consumption.

Drucker continues to pound home her constructivist approach to both subject and text by reiterating that a text or work is *produced* in the encounter facilitated by the book. This is another way of stating that book is not simply a window or a container through which we access and consume a text. Rather, book is a space that begs an encounter between user and the structured environment of the interface and more. Drucker's foregrounding of reading as production rather than simple consumption of a text performs the problematization of the production/consumption binary in Michel de Certeau's work, *The Practice of Everyday Life*.[^40]

De Certeau's explorations of 'the practice of everyday life' respect the deep concerns about commodification so well articulated by many materialist critiques of culture, yet questions the often accompanying low view of mass culture and pessimism concerning the everyman. De Certeau restores some poetic dignity to the masses by reframing consumption as *production*, giving each person in each moment an agency in the meaning making endeavor.

> As unrecognized producers, poets of their own acts, silent discoverers of their own paths in the jungle of functionalist rationality, consumers produce through their signifying practices.[^41]

I am not explicitly taking up the power dynamics de Certeau so beautifully explores in this work. Yet, his consistent challenge of the production/consumption binary without erasing the role of the structures or the participation of the "consumer" reinforces our approach here of book as interface that provokes production. De Certeau also helpfully highlights that book as interface does not necessarily erase the operations of book as container. The container attributes of book remain as a part of the material structures that constitute the potential productive space of the interface. Our theory of interface as space can resist the reduction of book to container and user to simple viewer without the need to eradicate the container aspects of book or the viewer aspects of user. 

De Certeau uses reading as one of his examples of "everyday practices that produce without capitalizing.”[^42] He notes the often assumed writing-reading binary as a specific example of the production-consumption binary, but articulates a notion of reading that can not be reduced to this dichotomy. Reading is a "silent production,” "a play of spaces,” "an 'art' which is anything but passive.”[^43] Reading as everyday practice is a poiesis, a making, within structured constraints that resists the production-consumption binary and thus offers a notion of reading as encounter that produces both the reader and the text.^[I'd like to add a little more here on the intersection or interface between Drucker and De Certeau.]

* Could reiterate James Watts here as well, when he suggests that all reading is a performance of sorts, thus a part of the performative dimension of scripture. 

**Probabilistic**

In an essay titled 'Entity to Event: From Literal, Mechanistic Materiality to Probabilistic Materiality,' Drucker expounds in much more detail her use of the term probabilistic as it relates to reading interfaces.

> Probabilistic materiality conceives of a text as an event, rather than an entity. The event is the entire system of reader, aesthetic object and interpretation – but in that set of relations, the text is constituted anew each time. Like weather produced in a system around a landmass, the shape of the reading has a codependent relation to the structure from which it arises. Probability is not free play. It is constrained play, with outcomes calculable in accord with the complexity of the system and range of variable factors, and their combinatoric and transformative relations over time. A text is a highly complex system, containing a host of thermal sinks and basics of attraction.[^44]

We can tell even in 'Interface Theory,' that probabilistic is an alternative to mechanistic for Drucker in her analysis of the shortcomings of interface design as driven by the software development world.[^45] Here, in this passage from 'Entity to Event,' with its strange alignment (I will include an image of the passage or try to format similiarly in Word to demonstrate her play with alignment), we can see her ability to both show and tell the role of materiality in the reading event. The basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the user with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time. This newness offered by a set of constrained possibilities echoes the property of emergence we encountered in interface as space. 

> With Such concepts in mind, we see the page, book, print, or screen space of text and image quite differently from the usual static presentation of thing, and see it instead as an active, dynamic field of forces and energies in dynamic suspension, acting on each other and within a frame of constraint, to produce the conditions a reader is provoked by in the constitutive act of reading that makes the text. Again I come back to the central premise that a text, work of art, aesthetic expression is an event not an entity. The material existence serves as a provocation, set of clues and cues for a performance of the text.[^46]  

Rather than simply presenting a user with an entity to consume, a probabilistic materiality of interface *provokes* production of both text and user in the practice of reading. Let's look more closely at the provocation of interface, which Drucker suggests is related to the cues and clues an interface offers for the performance of a text.

**Provoke**

I begin with the assumption that reading is a material act of production, no matter what the medium. Whether with an ancient papyrus roll, a medieval illuminated manuscript, a print codex, a computer screen, or a mobile phone, reading is an act shaped by both the materialities of the medium and the user.^[I am aware of the limitations of talking about medium and user as distinct entities and the ease with which we might slip into simple subject/object binaries here. One of the difficult tasks of this project is to challenge these dichotomies in so far as they encourage a subject consuming object model of reading. Perhaps the emerging discussions of object oriented ontology could provide an interesting conversation partner with interface theory. Imagining both medium and user as objects that have properties and methods they bring to an encounter could help emphasize the entangled production of reading as process model I am advocating for here.] There has been an upsurge of interest in the materiality of religion and the materiality of scripture in recent years.^[Give some examples from Wimbush and Signifying scriptures to Material Scripture section at SBL to Brent Plate and material religion to Manuel Vasquez Material Theory of Religion to Iconic Books.] The dethroning of textuality at work in this attention to the materiality of books and artifacts in religious traditions has deeply shaped my own approach to the study of bible. Yet, I want to push us to consider the materiality of the so called "virtual" -- digital technologies, computers, the internet, social media, mobile devices, the cloud, artificial intelligence.^[Drucker also challenges the material movement to consider more thoughtfully the materiality of the virtual, pointing back to the Abrahamic traditions of mapping matter to flesh (Drucker 2009, 7).] These media too have materialities that shape the encounters they afford and the idea of interface can help us stay attentive to the materiality of reading in the age of the internet.

Drucker celebrates the material provocation of reading interfaces. A codex doesn't simply lay passive on the shelf waiting to be opened and penetrated by the reader. The materiality of the book as interface participates in and provokes a reading event. A page from a book in Kindle reader on my iPhone, which gives me as user all kinds of power over the page, provokes a possible set of reading tactics, even if not entirely determinative. A print codex, with its bound spine, uniform page size, consistent font, and covers offers a user a different set of possible encounters. Neither of these interfaces, codex or Kindle reader on an iPhone are simply containers of information.  Book as container just waits to be consumed, book as interface provokes encounter.

This provocation reminds us that interface is an active participant as structured environment in the production of meaning that is a reading event. In the next chapter, we will look more closely at the material dispositions of an interface through the concept of affordances. Affordances are the set of real or perceived use possibilities offered by the material design of an interface *in relationship to a particular user and context*. As McGrenere and Ho demonstrate, there is a lot of debate and extension around this definition.[^See McGrenere and Ho, 'Affordances: Clarifying and Evolving a Concept,’ 1, for a brief history of the use of the term.]. For our purposes in this section on interfaces "provoking, the importance of pointing toward affordances is to remind us that there are material properties of an interface that present a possibility set of uses to a reader.

## Pathways ##

Thankfully, we already have some compelling and instructive examples of people trying to design book as interface in our emerging media age. John Miles Foley's *Pathways Project*[^49] offers an amazing example of exploring book as interface as both space and process that provokes probabilistic production in the reading event. Foley's academic work was in the area of medieval orality and Homeric poetry, which came to my attention during explorations of the relationship between oral forms and the construction of the Pauline letters in the New Testament. Foley, an early adopter of internet technologies, immediately noticed the analogies between oral tradition (oAgora) and the internet (eAgora) in their shared challenge to the operations of print media (tAgora). The Pathways Project was an experimental performance exploring these analogies. The Home page of the project says, 

> The major purpose of the Pathways Project is to illustrate and explain the fundamental similarities and correspondences between humankind’s oldest and newest thought-technologies: oral tradition and the Internet. Despite superficial differences, both technologies are radically alike in depending not on static products but rather on continuous processes, not on “What?” but on “How do I get there?” In contrast to the fixed spatial organization of the page and book, the technologies of oral tradition and the Internet mime the way we think by processing along pathways within a network. In both media it’s pathways – not things – that matter (http://www.pathwaysproject.org).

Foley's focus on process here is quite resonant with my suggestion that interface is process, even though Blumczynski's work has challenged me to approach this preference for process in a much less binary fashion, such that interface is also a space, a thing.^[Cite Piotr here] Though this particular quote seems rather dichotomous in suggesting that things do not matter, Foley himself was not after such a stark binary approach to the analogies he found between oral tradition and the internet. In fact, *The Pathways Project* was made available both as an interactive internet space and as a print volume, titled *Oral Tradition and the Internet*. As he always seemed to be, Foley was openly reflective about the process by which the relationship between these two medial forms of the project emerged and evolved over time. One of the values I appreciate in Foley's Pathways Project is his ability to question the print medium (tAgora) without having to throw it out as old or useless or worse. In his discussion of the print and online interfaces of the project, he talks about the values of each, the tAgora and the eAgora, and the process of translation that had to go on in order to make the project fit in these different media.^[http://www.pathwaysproject.org/pathways/show/Book_versus_Website . See my conclusion for some reflections on my own inability to perform this polyvalent approach to interface in this dissertation project. In fact, the form of the project you are reading now represents the tAgora version. For reasons of time and politics, I had to abandon the eAgora versions, though they are still in progress in their own right.] 

Although I admire Foley's willingness to work in both a print medium and in something beyond print, we will focus on what he calls the "wiki-website" version of the project as an example of book as interface that is space and process. As a space, *The Pathways Project* operates like many websites. There is a main home page that provides an introduction in the center of the page, links to other areas of the site on the left hand side, different translation options on the right, and a statement of the creative commons license covering the site in the footer of the page. There are browse menus and a search box provided in the left side panel as well as a "Getting Started" link at the top of the page to give people a suggested pathway if they need one. The openness of this main page signals a space that invites a user to participate in making their way through the project. One of the unique parts of the site is that as a user clicks on a link, the site tracks these clicks and builds a visualization of the "pathway" the user is making through the site. In fact, you can create a *user* account in the site and save your pathways and return to them later. This autogenerated linkmap shows all of the "nodes," Foley's preferred language for pages, a user has visited and numbered directional lines denoting the path taken between each node. In this linkmap, we see the interface offering a structure that signals the process by which the user is constructing their own experience of the space. Most websites with hyperlinks work this way, allowing the user to pave their own way through the content of the site. Yet, this simple visualization foregrounds the user's participation in constructing the space of interaction, the interface. 

Since we are discussing the relationship between a theory of interface and interface design, this linkmap feature of *The Pathways Project* gives us some great material for reflection. For example, in the quote above, we heard Foley suggest that in the eAgora, of which his project website is a participant, "it's pathways - not things - that matter" (http://www.pathwaysproject.org). Yet, in the linkmap, the nodes, which could be understood to represent the things, are far more prominent than the arrows, which are at the very least an important part of the pathways. If you want to interact with the linkmap, you click on a node, not on an arrow. If pathways matter, not things, it seems we might want to foreground the paths more than the nodes in our construction of the space. Now, I can think of many pragmatic reasons for making the nodes clickable, such as...MORE. Yet, here we have an example of where interface design can also inform our theoretical framings. Perhaps in the eAgora, things *and* pathways matter? Making the arrows in the linkmap clickable *along with* the nodes, or even instead of the nodes, would provide a simple spatial indication of the importance of pathways. 

Foley's Pathways Project and my argument for interface as space of interaction that supports difference are both challenging the dominance of print as a paradigm for how we know and how we relate through technologies, including language. The Pathways Project is full of insights and limits, both of which can provide useful launching places for our experiments here with book as interface. Unfortunately, Foley passed away in 2012, which means his *Pathways Project* has not received the kind of attention it might need to evolve with the emerging media technologies of today.^[Through my work with the Nida Institute, I had the distinct privilege of participating in a 3 day seminar oriented around the implications of Foley's work in the *Pathways Project* on the process of translation from print to other media. It was clear through these interactions that Foley was ahead of his time in experimenting with internet media and he had further aspirations for the Pathways Project in the direction of more collaboration, shared authoring, and even more dynamism in the interface. It is my hope in the future to return to Foley's project and help push it into even newer realms of exploration.]  

We now have a concept of interface as space of interaction that supports difference and a model of book as interface that provokes probabilistic production in the practice of reading and some examples of design in this direction. In the next chapter, I will advocate for one particular affordance in our design of bible as interface, anarchy.
