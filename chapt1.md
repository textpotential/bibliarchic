# CHAPTER 1: INTERFACE #

My suggestion that we think of bible as an anarchic interface has two main aims. First, bible as interface can challenge ideas and practices that reduce bible to simply a container of content to be consumed and can guide our imagination of bible in a time of major media transition. Second, an interface that resists our recourse to an original text or singular governing principle in the act of reading can help focus us on the vast productive potentialities of this interface even as it is translated into media technologies we have yet to imagine. Challenging the notions of container and the reign of the original are both ways of foregrounding the role of users in the production of bible. 

At its most basic, interface denotes some kind of relationship of interaction between entities. With this generic definition, we can imagine countless examples in everyday life, such as the the relationship of interaction between my son and his dog, or the relationship between neurotransmitters and receptors in a chemical synapse in your brain, or the relationship between my fingers and the beautifully designed butterfly keyboard I am using right now to type this sentence. Though I find a great deal of beauty in the ubiquitous relationality this broad imagination of interface offers, we will need a narrower definition of interface as we consider the relationship between bible and users. Even a quick glance at a dictionary entry for "interface" will highlight its relationaility and its importance in the realm of technology. 

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has entries for "interface" as both a noun and a verb. Interestingly, both noun and verb entries in the OED figure Marshall McLuhan, of "medium is the message" fame, prominently as the first quotation in the non-scientific definitions of the term. In fact, the OED credits McLuhan as the first user of "interface" in the verbal form in a 1967 collaborative effort with Quentin Fiore (McLuhan and Fiore 1967). This discussion of the OED may seem superfluous, given that I will not be using definitions from the OED as a starting point to form my own definitonIn both parts of speech, the google search define algorithm and the freely available Oxford Dictionaries online include a specific definition related to computing, which signals that the term has taken on special significance in the area of technology.[^googledef] 

[^googldef]: If I were working with a medium other than print here, I would embed the results from my google search for "define 'interface.'" The google search algorithm for definitions draws on many sources to provide a quick look at the main definitions of a term, its etymology, its frequency over time, and gives you the ability to translate the term into other languages. Due to the demands and customs of the print genre and related citation tendencies, I have chosen to reference a combination of OED and other useful definitions, particularly because the OED entries for this term are vastly outdated. Given my experience with this particular word, "interface," I can't help but question the subtitle of the OED online, which is "The definitive record of the English language." The google define algorithm results for "interface" can be found by running a google search on "define interface" and the Oxford Dictionaries Online free version entry can be found at https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface.

The first noun definition in the OED is the scientific definition, which denotes the boundary between two portions or phases of matter.^["interface, n.". OED Online. December 2016. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com.du.idm.oclc.org/view/Entry/97747?isAdvanced=false&result=1&rskey=QjGVLf& (accessed December 21, 2016).] Though this earliest use of the term is not our primary focus here, it is worth noting that even this scientific definition foregrounds difference as a necessary property of interface. Whether the interface identifies a boundary surface (the OED actually uses the term "face" here) within the same substance or between substances, the interface signals the place (or space) at which different entities interact. So, even in these early technical uses of the idea of interface in the late nineteenth century, we can hear the relationality and the difference at work in interface. A simple example like water in a pond shows the significance of a shift from speaking of just the surface of water to talking about the water/air interface. If we speak of just the surface of water, we focus only on the properties of water and its contained self relationality. Introducing the notion of interface here highlights the *relationship* water has with air, a *different* entity, both participating in the production of what we call the surface of water. 

As I mentioned above, the basic definition of "interface" as a noun is "A point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact."^[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface] This basic definition also encompasses the historical scientific definition if we add substances to the list of things that can meet and interact. Even though we often see the word "between" used with "interface," such as "the interface between religion and science," this simple definition of interface highlights that interface is a "point" or space or surface of meeting. This space of meeting is mutually constructed by the contact of the differing systems. Interface, in this sense, is not necessarily a space "between" two systems, but the space created by the entangled "interaction" of two systems. Since our definition states that systems must meet *and* interact, contact alone is not sufficient for interface, there must be some interaction among the systems. Again, we can see the demand for both difference and relationality in this idea of interface as space. 

It is important to carry these values of difference and relationality into the computing focused definition of interface as noun, which is "A device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer"^[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface] or "a device or program for connecting two items of hardware or software so that they can be operated jointly or communicate with each other."^[google "define interface"] Here we see that interface has become a technical term in the technological realm to describe the piece of technology that is needed to allow two systems to meet and interact. So, taking both the general definition and the computing definition together, we get something like interface enables interface. This computer interface is a thing that helps create the space for meeting and interacting between user and machine or machine and machine, a translation layer of sorts. 

## Reader as User ##

Two important terms introduced in this narrower definition of interface are "user" and "communicate." In computer interface, the two systems interacting are users and machines and the aim is a particular form of interaction, communication. Machine with machine interface is also important in computing, but since our focus here is on technologies of reading, I will only treat the user-machine interface for now.^[This immediately begs a question about the distinction between user and machine. With the rise of artificial intelligence, often machines are behaving in ways reserved traditionally for users, such as being readers of texts.] I find the role of users in the computing notion of interface wonderfully helpful for thinking about reading and bible, especially in times of technological transition, such as our current shift away from the dominance of print. We have deeply ingrained cultural notions of reading as a private exercise where a person picks up a book and reads silently over the pages. Even though the scarcity of silent reading in antiquity has been challenged, Harry Gamble's discussion of the aurality of reading in antiquity, particularly related to the common practice of *scriptio continua*, script without spaces or punctuation or other markers with which we are so familiar today, first interrupted my assumption that people have always read like we do today (Gamble 1995, 203-205).^[reading] More recently, William Johnson provides a useful analysis of the difference between reading in the bookroll culture of the Roman elite in the first two centuries of the common era and our modern reading practices (Johnson 2010). Johnson demonstrates that the difference in book technologies has a significant impact on the difference in book and reading culture, such that reading in antiquity had as much to do with oratory as it did the deciphering of letters (Johnson 2010, 29). I agree with Alberto Manguel in his *A History of Reading*, that there is something shared across time and space in this experience of reading, encountering the world and texts and making meaning out of them (Manguel 1996, 7). Reading is and has always been production. Yet, what is more pressing in our discussion here is the important relationship of difference between technologies and the reading practices they afford. Whether read predominantly silently or aloud, *scriptio continua* and bookrolls most definitely impacted the kind of interaction users had with texts. 

^[reading]: Gamble 1995, 321 n. 1 provides a helpful list of the classic sources arguing for the prevalence of audible reading in antiquity, including the most famous of the arguments made by Balough and the quote from Augustine that often gets used as evidence. Interestingly, Gamble includes in this list of sources an essay by Bernard M. W. Knox, which takes Balough to task and argues strongly against the conclusion that silent reading is exceedingly rare in antiquity. After a close reading of Balough's evidence and providing several additional texts that might speak to the issue, Knox concludes, "Ancient books were normally read aloud, but there is nothing to show that silent reading of books was anything extraordinary except the famous passage from Augustine's Confessions, and that is countered by the phrase of Cicero which makes sense only if understood as a reference to silent reading of lyric poets. As for letters and similar documents, Balogh's evidence is inadequate to start with and his case is blown sky-high by evidence he did not notice" (Knox 1968, 435).

Thus, given our narrow imagination of reading, due in part to the long reign of print, I prefer to talk about users instead of readers in our analysis of bible as interface. There are many reasons why I choose to interrupt our familiar notion of readers of bible. First, there are many uses of bible other than reading, such as ritual procession of bibles around a congregation, bibles as protective amulets, and bibles as decorative ornaments on a coffee table. Second, highlighting that readers are users and not the only users of bible reinforces the materiality of bible, both in the reading event and beyond. Emerging movements such as Material Religion, Institute for Signifying Scriptures, and SCRIPT have done a great deal to challenge the dominance of textuality in our conceptualization of both religion and scriptures. Redirecting our attention to bible users instead of simply bible readers is my attempt to support these movements and to keep our analysis embedded as much in the materiality of bible as in the cultural content it provides. Third, our emerging media age of mobile devices and the internet of things talks a great deal about the role of users in the production of interfaces. 

Consider the settings in my Kindle app that allow the user to determine the font size, page color, brightness, and other material aspects of the reading interface. Already, we can hear a subtle distinction here between reader as processor of the words in a book and user as participant in constructing the space that affords the reading event. In this case, the user is the reader, but also more. This shift toward more user participation in the construction of the space in which reader encounters text suggests a more complicated reading practice than we have been used to in print and hearkens back to our discussion of greater reader/orator participation demanded by *scriptio continua* in ancient bookrolls. Now, as an academic, I am well aware of much more active, material, and participatory reading practices in print than the basic caricature I portray here. For example the vast marginal notes and highlights offered by my committee members on early drafts of this very paragraph show an active and material participation in print. Yet, I would contend that this active participation in the space and process that is my dissertation pushes beyond our typical notions of what readers do. In this example, my committee members are using the interface of a paragraph to make something of their own, to add their own insights, to shape the space into something that fits their expectations and needs. This is reading, no doubt. But it pushes beyond reading to use. We can argue as to whether continuous script in a bookroll, chapter and section headings in a print codex, or variable page size in an electronic book reader produce more or less complicated reading environments. The hierarchical evaluation of these interfaces interests me less than their difference. My shift from reader to user is simply an attempt to tune our attention to these differences in relationship that constitute the interface that is reading. 

## Communicating Difference ##

Returning to our simple computing definition of interface, "A device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer,"^[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/interface] we find that the specific kind of interaction important to computer interface is communication. Because of the difference between the modes of communication of a user, let's assume a human user, and a machine, an "interface" is needed to allow interaction. Here in the computing definition of interface, we find the noun and verb operations of interface coming together, a space of meeting and entanglement that facilitates interaction, even communication. The verbal definitions of interface are simply this, "to interact with" or "to connect with."^[link to Oxford online] We have seen a movement from interface as boundary of separation indicating difference in the early scientific uses of the term to the more explicitly active connecting and communicating aspects of interface in the computing world. As I noted above, even the early boundary notions of interface demand both difference and connection, but we have moved now into the realm of exchange, perhaps even language, with computer interface.

The simplicity of these verbal forms and my brevity in addressing them are not indicative of the importance I place on the verbal aspect of interface. In fact, I concur here with Johanna Drucker, that the more interesting manifestation of interface is in its verbal character -- event more than entity (Drucker 2011, ??). Yet, our difficult task here is to explore bible as interface without reducing interface to any one of these definitions at the expense of the other. Interface is a space that fosters a process of interaction that foregrounds the values of difference and relationality.

A few examples will help highlight this specific use of the term in the technological realm. A web page is often thought of as an interface of the computing variety.  and an API...

## Two cultural metaphors for interface ##

Before we move on to explore interface as both space and process through Johanna Drucker's suggestion of interface as zone of encounter, I'd like to mention two other important examples of interface that have shaped my thinking significantly: the relationship between new media object and cultural interface in Lev Manovich and S. Brent Plate's discussion of *The Skin of Religion*.^[I'd like to highlight that my attraction to interface as a concept emerged out of conversations I had about water as a surface with Timothy Beal at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014. In Beal's lectures at NSTS 2014, he offered the idea of bible as media and we discussed the possibility of water as a metaphor for this phenomenon. It was the material and theoretical connotations of water as sur-face, both in the biological realm and in Hebrew scriptures that pushed me to consider the possibility of bible as interface.]

## Reading as Material Production ##

I will focus primarily on the readerly uses of bible, these relationships between user and interface, which produce the material encounters that constitute the reading process. I begin with the assumption that reading is a material act of production, no matter what the medium. Reading is material. Whether with an ancient papyrus roll, a medieval illuminated manuscript, a print codex, a computer screen, or a mobile phone, reading is an act shaped by both the materialities of the medium and the user.^[I am aware of the limitations of talking about medium and user as distinct entities and the ease with which we might slip into simple subject/object binaries here. One of the difficult tasks of this project is to challenge these dichotomies in so far as they encourage a subject consuming object model of reading. Perhaps the emerging discussions of object oriented ontology could provide an interesting conversation partner with interface theory. Imagining both medium and user as objects that have properties and methods they bring to an encounter could help emphasize the entangled production of reading as process model I am advocating for here.] There has been an upsurge of interest in the materiality of religion and the materiality of scripture in recent years.^[Give some examples from Wimbush and Signifying scriptures to Material Scripture section at SBL to Brent Plate and material religion to Manuel Vasquez Material Theory of Religion to Iconic Books.] The dethroning of textuality at work in this attention to the materiality of books and artifacts in religious traditions has deeply shaped my own approach to the study of bible. Yet, I want to push us to consider the materiality of the so called "virtual" -- digital technologies, computers, the internet, social media, mobile devices, the cloud, artificial intelligence.^[Drucker also challenges the material movement to consider more thoughtfully the materiality of the virtual, pointing back to the Abrahamic traditions of mapping matter to flesh (Drucker 2009, 7).] These media too have materialities that shape the encounters they afford and the idea of interface can help us stay attentive to the materiality of reading in the age of the internet. 

Reading is production. This may seem like an obvious statement, but it is important to remember that in any medium, a book is not simply a container of information to be ingested by a reader. The materialities and cultural contexts of both book and user entangle to produce the possibility for meaning in a reading act. Each encounter between book and user has the potential to offer something different, because reading is a production of meaning contingent upon the particularities of the encounter and its participants. If I read Emmanuel Levinas's *Otherwise than Being* in a hard bound print monograph as an undergraduate student in the early 2000's while sitting in the library at a small liberal arts college in Colorado, this will produce something different than my reading of the same text on a computer screen in a continuous scroll text editor as a late stage doctoral student in my house at the dawn of a Trump presidency. Though the "content" or the words of the text may remain identical in both of these cases, the readings simply can not remain the same. These two reading events are moments in the ongoing making that is my reading of *Otherwise Than Being*. In this sense, perhaps it would be more useful to talk about reading with a book rather than reading a book to help unsettle our typical notions of reading as consumption. 

## Interface as Space and Process ##

If interface is a product of relations, not simply the material affordances of a technology, then interface is a space and a process, not simply a thing (Drucker 2011, 3). With this notion of interface as space and process, we need a way to talk about the participants in this spatial process. In her advocacy for humanistic approaches to interface design, Drucker suggests that the participants in this interface are subject(s) and platform(s) or environment.^[We will see similar distinctions between subject and environment in the discussion of affordances below.] Drucker begins with the assumption of a constructivist subject, constituted in the reading event. If there is a theory of subject I am compelled by, it is a constructivist one and I support both Drucker's rejection of the "mechanistic consumer-model of autonomous viewer" notion of subject and her focus on the mutuality of platform and "subject" in constructing the space that is interface (Drucker 2011, 3). Yet, I wonder if a return to subject is our only option to challenge the consumptive and mechanistic conception of user often promoted in software design?

What if we leveled the playing field philosophically here and instead of leaning back toward the well trodden interplay of subject and object, even constructivist subject, in this space that is interface, we considered all participants as objects? One of the aims stated at the beginning of this chapter was to challenge the tendency toward an original text or a singular governing principle as the arbiter of meaning in the act of reading. If we rearticulate a subject as part of interface, how does this subject not become the singular governing principle? What if human participants in an interface are simply one type of object interacting with other objects to produce an event? A combination of Bill Brown's thing theory and the emerging discipline of Object Oriented Philosophy might offer us a way to imagine the participant in interface as things or objects without being reduced to the mechanistic consumption that Drucker rightfully cautions against. Yet, insofar as object oriented theories resist process thought, we might have a problem here. This insight makes me wonder if actually Piotr's work on process might already offer us something other than subject/object nomenclature to discuss the participants in interface.

In order to better understand this productive process of reading, we will look toward interface theory. Often, we associate interface with digital technologies. Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) have become major areas of study and discourse in the world of software design.^[Give some examples.] If we look at the basic uses of '[interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=interface+definition)' in the English language, we can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as the prevalent use in the computing arena.^[Google Search for 'interface definition’ on August 1, 2015.] When I take up the language of interface, I do not want to limit our conversation to digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. Interface offers a broader category for spaces of encounter that include many forms of media and mediation. In order to more clearly articulate the rich possibilities of interface, I will offer three related ways to think of interface theoretically - interface as zone of encounter, interface as thirdspace, and interface as process. 

## Interface as Zone of Encounter ##

It was Johanna Drucker's essay, "Humanities Approaches to Interface Theory," that first led me to consider the notion of bible as interface (Drucker 2011). Drucker helpfully intertwines digital media studies explorations of interface design with humanities questions of subjectivity to provide a theoretical foundation for interface as a zone of encounter. In an exemplary fashion, Drucker demonstrates a reflexive practice by stating her desire to explore the theory undergirding her own scholarly working environments at the cusp of a transition from print to other dominant media/interfaces, saying, 

> The motivation here is simple. The authoring and reading environments for interpretative scholarly work are only just beginning to be designed in such a way that the linear, finite conventions of print media can be changed for the constellationary, distributed, multi-faceted modes of digital media...As this process develops, a challenge for humanists is to reflect on and articulate the theory of interface that underlies the design of our working environments (Drucker 2011, 2).

Drucker shows her awareness of the shifts at work in the emerging digital media age and asks us as humanists to become a part of the process of constructing a theory to support the design of our reading and writing spaces as a counter balance to the often mechanistic principles at work in software design.[^26] I see this project as contributing to these efforts and I am grateful for the challenge from Drucker and others. As she looks to GIS, social networking, and visualization for hints of new possibilities, we may even look back into print technologies (e.g. Talmudic page) for some suggestions toward interface design that might afford a bible textual apparatus that is "constellationary, distributed, and multi-faceted." 

Combining graphical reading analysis, frame analysis, and a constructivist model of subjectivity, Drucker gives us a view of interface that is more of a theater than a window.

> Interface in a dynamic space, a Zone in which reading takes place. We do not look rather through it (in spite of the overwhelming force of the 'windows' metaphor) or past it. The desktop metaphor at least Suggests a space of activity in which icons stand for objects with behaviors we enact. The surface of the screen is not merely a portal for access to something that lies beyond or behind this display. Intellectual content and activities do not exist independent of these embodied representations. Interface, like any other component of computational Systems, is an artifact of complex processes and protocols, a Zone in which our behaviors and actions take place. Interface is what we read and how we read combined through engagement. Interface is a provocation to cognitive experience.[^27]

Instead of a thing, interface is a zone of encounter. So, if we turn toward books and reading more specifically, 'Interface is *what we read* and *how we read* combined through engagement.’[^28] This is a critical point in the relationship of bible and/as media. If an interface involves both what we read and how we read, the design of the book technologies we use when reading shapes the reading performance and meaning made as much as the content. Reading bible in a codex is a different zone of encounter than reading bible on an iPhone, thus, both the book and the reader are constituted differently in these two interfaces. This means that the transitions from scroll to codex and codex to internet are not simply new ways of reading the same content. Rather, bible and reader are both transformed in the new space of encounter made possible by these different interfaces.

Another way to state the importance of interface in the reading process is to suggest that the structures of a particular book technology ARE information, not merely a means of access to information. This is another way of bothering the dichotomy between form and content or medium and message. In this interface as zone of encounter, medium and message are so inextricably entangled that attempting to tease them apart is futile. Drucker highlights this well, saying,

> A book is an interface, so is a newspaper page, a bathroom faucet, a car dashboard, an ATM machine. An interface is not so much a 'between' space as it is the mediating environment that makes the experience, a 'critical zone that constitutes a user experience'. I don't access 'data' through a web page; I access a web page that is structured so I can perform certain kinds of queries or searches. We know that the structure of an interface is information, not merely a means of access to it.[^29]

In this example, the "page"[^30] is not simply a window through which a user accesses data. Rather, the page is a part of the data and the data, in part, structures the page. So, with a codex, the space of the page is part of the data of the text, not simply a delivery mechanism. The shift from zone to space in Drucker's language here, particularly a space that is something other than a space 'between,' points toward a second way of theorizing interface through Edward Soja's notion of thirding. 

## Interface as Space ##

In her explorations of interface theory, Drucker is mostly focused on scholarly reading and writing practices and the role of the human subject in the construction of interfaces. The spatiality of her own work is highlighted in her use of graphical reading practices and frame analysis to build her theory of interface as zone of encounter (Drucker 2011, 3-8). If, as Drucker suggests in the quote above, interface is a space of encounter, but something more than simply a space between, then we can imagine resonances between Drucker's interface theory and Edward Soja's theory of space. Soja begins his introduction to *Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places* with a focus on participatory construction of space, saying, 

> We are becoming increasingly aware that we are, and always have been, intrinsically spatial beings, active participants in the social construction of our embracing spatialities. Perhaps more than ever before, a strategic awareness of this collectively created spatiality and its social consequences has become a vital part of making both theoretical and practical sense of our contemporary lifeworlds at all scales, from the most intimate to the most global (Soja 1996, 1).

This idea that we are "active participants in the social construction" of space echoes Drucker's focus on a constructivist subjectivity in her theory of interface. For both Soja and Drucker it is not simply that we together construct space but also that spaces construct us as we construct spaces. Soja's mention of "social consequences" here hearkens to Marshall McLuhan's famous adage that "the medium is the message." Though often misunderstood as reductionist or absolutist, McLuhan is simply suggesting that the message of any medium is its social effect not the simply the content it contains (McLuhan 1964, 8).^[Perhaps it would have been more helpful to hold both directions of this famous apposition together such that medium is message and message is medium.] In the tradition of McLuhan, both Soja and Drucker emphasize that our materiality, which can be called media or can be called spatiality, has a significant impact on our sociality, even in digital environments. 

Combining Henri Lefebvre's "lived space" and Jorge Luis Borges's "Aleph", Soja articulates Thirdspace as a radical simultaneity where all spaces and all binaries come together (Soja 1996, 56-57). As Jacob Kinnard suggests in his preface to *Spaces in Motion*, Soja's notion of Thirdspace is "complex, slippery, and often frustrating" (Kinnard 2014, xv), so I will only attempt to draw the necessary connections between the possibilities of Thirdspace and my reflections on interface. Soja suggests that his notion of Thirdspace is closest to the third moment in Lefebvre's trialectic of social space, "lived space" (Soja 1996a, 68).^[Soja provides a discussion of Lefebvre's multiple names for this third moment in his trialectic as both "spaces of representation" and "lived space," but even at the cost of oversimplification, perhaps inevitable when trying to write or talk about these things, I will only use "lived space" (Soja 1996, 65).] This lived space of Lefebvre's is both separate from and the complex composite of the spatial practices (perceived space) and the conceptions of space (conceived space) that make up the other components of social spatiality (Soja 1996, 67-68). What is import for our theory of interface is not the specific components that make up this lived space, or Thirdspace in Soja, but the methodology that undergirds even the articulation of this model.

The critical methodology at work in this notion of Thirdspace, Soja calls "Thirding-as-Othering," which is the mechanism by which his (and Lefebvre's) spatial analysis resists reduction to binarisms or dichotomies such as real/virtual, subject/object, or user/interface (Soja 1996, 60-61). As with the rest of his ideas in *Thirdspace*, Soja "approximates" this methodology of thirding-as-othering from Lefebvre's anti-reductionist approach described by the phrase "there is always an-Other."^[Add Fench in a footnote.] Soja's thirding provides a focus on space not as a simple combination of two forces, such as the social and the historical, but rather as a methodology that always attends to a third term that can emerge in the process of encounter. Soja writes, 

> Thirding introduces a critical 'other-than' choice that speaks and critiques through
its otherness. That is to say, it does not derive simply from an additive combination of its binary antecedents but rather from a disordering, deconstruction, and tentative reconstitution of their presumed totalization producing an open alternative that is both similar and strikingly different (Soja 1996, 61).

For example, a print book as a platform presents a set of constraints and possibilities on a reading event as does a particular reader sitting in an arm chair on a snowy Sunday afternoon. In this process of interface, thirding suggests that the combinatorial set of possibilities offered by the intersection of platform and user do not *determine* the productive potential of this interface. There is always an Other possibility that can emerge in the process of encounter that can surprise or interrupt our expecations. It is this interruptive emergence and its insistence on resisting a closed system that thirding offers our theory of interface. Drucker's notion of interface as zone of encounter, with its constructivist approach, already challenges the mechanistic and determinative binaries of user and technological platform, encouraging a more spatial, material, and constructed notion of both media and the subject. Soja's Thirding-as-Othering, which practices an infinite preference for an alternative when faced with a binary choice, adds the property of emergence to our theory of interface (Soja 1996b, 1421). This explicit and intentional methodology of surfacing multiplicity and the possibility for unexpected newness when faced with a binary may not yet guide interface design or theory like it does Soja's cultural critique. Yet, Soja's Thirding-as-Othering provides us a disposition toward emergence of the chaotic kind, possibilities that arise in the process of interface that challenge established categories and resist closed analysis without a need to eradicate these categories. Interface as thirding pushes the multiplicity Drucker encourages in her framing of interface toward a property of emergence in interface that will always overflow our analysis. Drucker says,

> Interface and its relation to reading has to be theorized as an environment in which varied behaviors of embodied and situated persons will be enabled differently according to its many affordances. That kind of statement is so maddeningly vague and abstract that it seems almost useless.[^36]

Drucker resists the strictly functional and mechanistic theories of interface design and asks humanists to imagine something more variable and responsive to the particularities of the people and the spaces involved in interface. Interface as thirding suggests that even these combinatorial particularities do not produce the total set of possibilities, 'there is always an-Other.' Interface as thirding can push beyond the simple intersection of two systems, book and reader, toward attending to processes that foster emergence. This emergent property of thirding reminds us that interface is not simply the sum of the parts offered by platform and reader. Instead, in interface, something new is made; reading is production. We will return to this concept of emergence below in our discussion of book as interface. 

```
Maybe add a section here on different notions of emergence or wait and do this down in the probability section

Actually, I might throw out all of this and put a different theory of emergence in its place. 
```

## Interface as Process and Product ##

With Piotr Blumczynski's new book *Ubiquitous Translation*[^37] and the focus on the WHAT and HOW, I feel like I could link the WHAT and HOW of reading in Drucker to the WHAT and HOW of translation and suggest that interface is a kind of translational event. In a sense then, we have at least two kinds of translations going on with bible, a material media translation of book from print codex to mobile phone as well as the translational act that is interface.

## Book as Interface ##

So, we have moved from the mechanistic idea of interface as a thing through which we view data, to a constructivist interface as a zone of encounter that constitutes a space and a subject, finally to a spatial interface as thirdspace with a disposition toward interruptive emergence. The important strand that follows this trajectory is the continued challenge to any compartmentalization of what and how we read. Just as interface is not simply a thing we look through, a book is not just a container for content. A book is an invitation to an encounter in the practice of reading and the materiality of this encounter has as much to tell us about meaning as the stories we read.

Near the end of her exhortation to humanities scholars to take seriously the task of building a theory of interface, Drucker reminds us that book has always been an interface.

> Though the coming of electronic media helped bring these observations into focus, the dynamic operations of the codex could already be described before the coming of hypertext, as we have seen. Clearly those with rich experience of book culture perceive the dynamic properties usually attributed to new media already active and present within the older forms, and rightly so. The book is no more self-identical, static, or fixed, than any other artifact that provokes a constitutive reading or response. Strict binarisms and technophilic exuberance lend themselves to exaggerated inaccuracies and hyperbolic rhetorical claims-charming in their own way, but perhaps not so useful for actual design. Many points of continuity exist between print and digitally networked artifacts and these don't have to depend on the seductive, special-effects, images of frictionless manipulation in holographic information spaces that will supposedly enable our lives in some fantasmatic future. Books, after all, are structured environments that provoke a reading that is probabilistic, not mechanistic, and the text or work is produced as an event, not an entity.[^38]

I quote Drucker here at length for two reasons. First, I have at times been prone to and accused of the charming 'strict binarisms and technophilic exuberance' Drucker cautions of here. Though I have found hyperbolic rhetoric useful at times to unsettle our unquestioned assumptions about media, I want to be exceedingly clear that, with Drucker, I am not interested in propagating some old/new hierarchical dichotomy between codex and emerging book technologies. This is why I introduced material media translation as a palimpsest at the outset of this project.^[Give a note to direct back to that part of introduction] Each emerging book technology is a translation of what came before it, a writing over that never fully replicates and only partially erases.

Second, this passage from Drucker begins and ends with a reminder that book has always been an interface. As the materiality of this interface shifts, we will undoubtedly learn from previous forms as we explore the affordances of emerging technologies. The last full sentence of this passage captures nicely the importance of understanding book as interface. To paraphrase in alliterative fashion, Drucker suggests that a book is an interface that *provokes probabilistic production* through the reading event.[^39] Let's look closely at each of these p-words in reverse order, production, probabilistic, and provokes.

### Production ###

Drucker continues to pound home her constructivist approach to both subject and text by reiterating that a text or work is *produced* in the encounter facilitated by the book. This is another way of stating that book is not simply a window or a container through which we access and consume a text. Rather, book is a space (is it too reductionist to correlate space and 'a structured environment' in Drucker?) that begs an encounter between reader and the structured environment of the interface and more. Drucker's foregrounding of reading as production rather than simple consumption of a text reminds me of the problematization of the production/consumption binary in Michel de Certeau's work, *The Practice of Everyday Life*.[^40]

De Certeau's explorations of 'the practice of everyday life' respect the deep concerns about commodification so well articulated by many materialist critiques of culture, yet questions the often accompanying low view of mass culture and pessimism concerning the everyman. De Certeau restores some poetic dignity to the masses by reframing consumption as *production*, giving each person in each moment an agency in the meaning making endeavor.

> As unrecognized producers, poets of their own acts, silent discoverers of their own paths in the jungle of functionalist rationality, consumers produce through their signifying practices.[^41]

I am not explicitly taking up the power dynamics de Certeau so beautifully explores in this work. Yet, his consistent challenge of the production/consumption binary without erasing the role of the structures or the participation of the 'consumer' reinforces our approach here of book as interface that provokes production. De Certeau also helpfully reminds me that book as interface does not necessarily erase the operations of book as container. The container attributes of book remain as a part of the material structures that constitute the potential productive space of the interface.

De Certeau uses reading as one of his examples of "everyday practices that produce without capitalizing.”[^42] He notes the often assumed writing-reading binary as a specific example of the production-consumption binary, but articulates a notion of reading that can not be reduced to this dichotomy. Reading is a "silent production,” "a play of spaces,” "an 'art' which is anything but passive,” and most poingnantly, reading "transforms another person's property into a space borrowed for a mo-ment by a transient.”[^43]  Reading as everyday practice is a poiesis, a making, within structured constraints that resists the production-consumption binary and thus offers a notion of reading as encounter that produces both the reader and the text.

### Probabilistic ###

In an essay titled 'Entity to Event: From Literal, Mechanistic Materiality to Probabilistic Materiality,' Drucker expounds in much more detail her use of the term probabilistic as it relates to reading interfaces.

> Probabilistic materiality conceives of a text as an event, rather than an entity. The event is the entire system of reader, aesthetic object and interpretation – but in that set of relations, the text is constituted anew each time. Like Weather produced in a system around a landmass, the shape Of the reading has a COdependent relation to the structure from which it arises. Probability is not free play. It is Constrained play, With Outcomes calculable in accord with the Complexity Of the System and range Of Variable factors, and their Combinatoric and transformative relations Over time. A text is a highly complex System, containing a host of thermal sinks and basics of attraction.[^44]

We can tell even in 'Interface Theory,' that probabilistic is an alternative to mechanistic for Drucker in her analysis of the shortcomings of interface design as driven by the software development world.[^45] Here, in this passage from 'Entity to Event,' with its strange alignment, we can see her ability to both show and tell the role of materiality in the reading event. This claim of event rather than entity is parallel to my suggestion that book as interface is an encounter not just a container. The basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time.

> With Such concepts in mind, We see the page, bOok, print, Or Screen space Of text and image quite differently from the usual static presentation of thing, and see it instead as an active, dynamic field of forces and energies in dynamic suspension, acting On each Other and Within a frame Of Constraint, to produce the conditions a reader is provoked by in the constitutive act of reading that makes the text. Again I come back to the central premise that a text, work of art, aesthetic expression is an event not an entity. The material existence serves as a provocation, set of clues and cues for a performance of the text.[^46]

This points back, in a way, to the interruptive emergence we found in Soja's notion of thirdspace and begs a further discussion about the role of complexity theory in Drucker's concept of interface as event. MORE ON COMPLEXITY, PROBABILITY, AND EMERGENCE.

Rather than simply presenting a user with an entity to consume, a probabilistic materiality of interface *provokes* production of both text and subject in the practice of reading. Let's look more closely at the provocation of interface, which Drucker suggests is related to the cues and clues an interface offers for the performance of a text.

### Provoke ###

I love that Drucker celebrates the provocation of reading interfaces. A codex doesn't simply lay passive on the shelf waiting to be opened and penetrated by the reader. The materiality of the book as interface participates in and even provokes a reading event. A page from a book in Amazon reader on my iPhone, which gives me as reader all kinds of power over the page, provokes a possibility set of reading tactics, even if not entirely determinative. Book as container just waits to be consumed, book as interface provokes encounter.

This provocation reminds us that interface is an active participant as structured environment in the production of meaning that is a reading event. In the next chapter, we will look more closely at the material dispositions of an interface through the concept of affordances. Affordances are the set of real or perceived use possibilities offered by the material design of an interface *in relationship to a particular user and context*. As McGrenere and Ho demonstrate, there is a lot of debate and extension around this definition.[^See McGrenere and Ho, 'Affordances: Clarifying and Evolving a Concept,’ 1, for a brief history of the use of the term.]. For our purposes in this section on interfaces "provoking, the importance of pointing toward affordances is to remind us that there are material properties of an interface that present a possibility set of uses to a reader.

## Paving the Way ##

### Pathways Project ###

Thankfully, we already have some compelling and instructive examples of people trying to design book as interface in our emerging media age. John Miles Foley's *Pathways Project*[^49] offers an amazing example of exploring book as interface as both space and process that provokes probabilistic production in the reading event. Foley's academic work was in the area of medieval orality and Homeric poetry, which came to my attention during explorations of the relationship between oral forms and the construction of the Pauline letters in the New Testament. Foley, an early adopter of internet technologies, immediately noticed the analogies between oral tradition (oAgora) and the internet (eAgora) in their shared challenge to the operations of print media (tAgora). The Pathways Project was an experimental performance exploring these analogies. The Home page of the project says, 

> The major purpose of the Pathways Project is to illustrate and explain the fundamental similarities and correspondences between humankind’s oldest and newest thought-technologies: oral tradition and the Internet. Despite superficial differences, both technologies are radically alike in depending not on static products but rather on continuous processes, not on “What?” but on “How do I get there?” In contrast to the fixed spatial organization of the page and book, the technologies of oral tradition and the Internet mime the way we think by processing along pathways within a network. In both media it’s pathways – not things – that matter (http://www.pathwaysproject.org).

Foley's focus on process is quite resonant with my suggestion here that interface is process, even though Blumczynski's work has challenged me to approach this preference for process in a much less binary fashion, such that interface is also a space, a thing. One way to imagine a congruence in approach between my articulation of interface and Foley's Pathways Project is that both are challenging the dominance of print as a paradigm for how we know and how we relate through technologies, including language. 

The Pathways Project is full of insights and limits, both of which can provide useful launching places for our experiments here with book as interface.

Unfortunately, Foley passed away in 2012, which means his *Pathways Project* has not received the kind of attention it might need to evolve with the growing internet and mobile media technologies of today. Through my work with the Nida Institute, I had the distinct privilege of participating in a 3 day seminar oriented around the implications of Foley's work in the *Pathways Project* on the process of translation from print to other media. 

### Future of Academic Book ###

In her essay, Drucker makes some hints toward what we might find in emerging scholarly interpretive reading interfaces. There is a movement afoot that is gently and gradually trying to take seriously this call to imagine the academic book as interface in our emerging media landscape. The Future of the Academic Book project began as a collaborative project...Though I have had a hard time seeing how the FOAB project has interrupted the established dispositions of print and codex to allow the possibilities of emerging technologies, the community of discourse that has fostered this movement has most definitely demonstrated a desire for and commitment to a constructivist and collaborative process. Their patience and respect for tradition could create the necessary space for translation of the deeply ingrained material sensibilities embedded in the culture of the academic book. I hope to incorporate the innovative spirit and the patient wisdom of both Drucker and the FOAB project as we push toward imagining bible as interface.

We now have a model of book as interface that provokes probabilistic production in the practice of reading and some examples of design in this direction. In the next chapter, I will advocate for one particular affordance in our design of bible as interface, anarchy.
