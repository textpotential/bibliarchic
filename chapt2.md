# CHAPTER 2: AFFORDING ANARCHY

We have seen that book as interface provokes probabilistic production in a reading event. If part of interface design involves constructing material spaces that might encourage certain affordances, can we design toward a reading process that is anarchic? 

My goal here is to connect the notions of anarchy and proximity in Levinas as a theoretical grounding for interface design that affords reading which is not primarily governed by consuming the content of a container, but encourages contact without grasp. Just as Drucker offers probabilistic production as an alternative to mechanical determinism, so here, I will offer the anarchy of proximity as an alternative to consumptive mastery in the practice of reading. Not only does bible offer a zone of encounter for provoking probabilistic production in the practice of reading, but, I argue, bible can be an *anarchic interface*, an interface not governed by a singular original, theme, or principle. Extending Levinas's description of the pre-conscious ethical encounter in the face to face as proximity, I will operationalize this proximity in interface design as a space with depth that opens up possibility for contact without grasp, thus reading not governed by an original (an-arche). 

As a student of bible for much of my life, in personal practice or scholarly pursuit, the reign of αρχη has dominated both my concept of textual tradition and any notion of manuscript awareness. The archic logocentrism of my evangelical exegetical training became immediately apparent in the first verse we learned to read in Greek - εν αρχη ην ο λογος (John 1.1). It is αρχη and all of its resonances with the *beginning* of LXX Genesis that signals the reign of λογος in a Christian interpretive tradition that claims to take the verbal character of *the* bible seriously as divine revelation. Couple this with the tenth article of the [1978 Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy](http://library.dts.edu/Pages/TL/Special/ICBI_1.pdf), which links inspiration and "the [λογος] of God" with the *original, autographic text of Scripture*, and we can see the deep archic sensibilities of the tradition in which I was reared, even at the material manuscript level.

### Apostolicity in Canon Discussions

Though our awareness of the complicated history of canon consciousness is growing, one place we can see the reign of an original in the production of bible is in the conversations around acceptable scriptures and canon in early Christian communities.[^Recall my brief explanation of the difference between scripture and bible as I use them here. Scripture is a broader category that denotes a writing that is deemed authoritative for a particular religious community (Wimbush 2008 - Theorizing Scriptures, ??). Bible is a specific expression of scripture by Judeo-Christians traditions and denotes a collection of authoritative writings in a book for use by a particular community.] As noted in other places, I am more interested here in the *process* of evaluation of writings that should or should not be considered as bible than in any final or definitive product. One of the common criteria we find used by early Christian church communities to decide whether to consider a writing as scripture is apostolicity. 

For a writing to be apostolic, it had to be written by an apostle or by a near associate of an apostle. For example, in his 39th Festal Letter in the year 362, often considered the earliest full list of the 27 New Testament writings as we have them in contemporary versions of bible, Athanasius follows the archaeological historical method of the Gospel according to Luke and says, 
> It being my intention to mention these matters, I shall, for the commendation of my venture, follow the example of the evangelist Luke and say [cf. Luke 1:1-4]: Since some have taken in hand to set in order for themselves the so-called apocrypha and to mingle them with the God-inspired scripture, concerning which we have attained to a sure persuasion, according to what the original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers, I also, having been urged by true brethren and having investigated the matter from the beginning, have decided to set forth in order the writings that have been put in the canon, that have been handed down and confirmed as divine, in order that every one who has been led astray may condemn his seducers, and that every one who has remained stainless may rejoice, being again reminded of that (Cite traditional translation).
There are two archic moments worth mentioning in this early witness to the discussions around writings deemed "God-inspired scripture." Athanasius sets up his listing as that which is handed down from the "original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers." This is a direct statement of the apostolic criterion, writings which originate from the direct teaching of Jesus through the authorship of original eye-witnesses. There is a positive correlation in this tradition between the arche and logos of John 1:1 and the impulse to use the origin of Jesus's words passed down through his apostles as a governing criteria for deciding what constitutes bible. The second archic moment is found in the statement of historical method borrowed from the Gospel according to Luke, "Having investigated the matter from the beginning." Here again we find recourse to a beginning or origin as the governing principle for determining what is meaningful. 

Now, as Harry Gamble and Lee Martin McDonald have highlighted, the canonization process is and has always been complicated and the archic impulse of the criterion of apostolicity was not sufficient alone for consideration nor was it the only variable operative in these conversations (Gamble 1985, ; McDonald 2002, ). Yet, some of the other criteria also lend themselves to the archic impulse, governed by an origin or a singular principle, such as antiquity (earliest writings) and orthodoxy (fits accepted principles of faith).

Interestingly, the majority of writings considered for this category come from the first or second century of the common era (criteria of antiquity) and have no internal identification of authorship at all, they are anonymous or even pseudepigraphic.[^List here the writings that have textual authorial identification, those that do not, and those considered pseudepigraphic with a citation for more info on pseudepigraphy.] Thus, considerations of authorship by early Christian communities were based on passed down tradition about the origin of these writings as much as the writings themselves. 

It took David Parker's careful questioning of this αρχη or original of the manuscript tradition in [*The Living Text of the Gospels*]() to awaken me to the anarchy at work even in the materiality of bible. Yet, Parker never invokes the language of anarchy. Aware of the ancient Greek semantic potential of αρχη, Emmanuel Levinas, another close reader of biblical texts and tradition, introduced me to an anarchy that was something beyond disorder as another order and something significantly more complicated than the simple absence of a beginning or origin. In his essay titled "Substitution," Levinas takes up the relationship between proximity and the αρχη. At many points in this project, we will struggle with the potential of proximity, from spatial nearness and distance to ap-proximat-ion to a notion of contact without grasp. But for now, we will focus on the anarchic.

### Without the Reign of an Original 

I would like to move from probabilistic production to anarchy to proximity as a reading methodology demonstrated by Levinas in his Talmudic readings. Let us not lose sight of our focus here as we delve into the complicated weavings of Levinas's writing and thinking. My question is about the particular relationship between anarchy and proximity in Levinas's writings as it might influence reading interfaces. It is a coincidence that interface contains the word face, a critical material sign used by Levinas to imagine the anarchy of proximity. I also do not take for granted that Levinas's own reading practices and much of his philosophical thought emerge in his encounter with bible through his Jewish tradition.

This bit may need to move but the connection between anarchy and face is important, perhaps as a transition to proximity. As I mentioned in the beginning of my chapter on interface, it was in part the simple semantic correlation between inter-face and the face to face in Levinas that raised my curiosity about the possible relationship between the anarchy at work in the face to face and bible as interface. One way to parse this process in Levinas's writings is that the face initiates a proximity, a zone of encounter (recall Drucker's discussion of interface) that is both near and distant, which in turn affords anarchic relations, relations not governed by one subject's ability to comprehend, understand, or categorize another subject. So, in the ethical relation, the face is an interface, proximity describes a particular kind of zone of encounter that demands contact without grasp, and anarchy suggests a process of meaning production that is not entirely determined by established principles and norms. Here, I am suggesting a close relationship between the provocation of probabilistic production characteristic of interface and the anarchy of the proximity of the face in the ethical encounter.

I wonder if a note here or a paragraph on the difference between face and facade in Levinas (Reality and it's Shadow) as it relates to interface. It is my experience that many address new media interfaces as a facade, partly indebted to the Frankfurt school's devaluation of mass media. I am arguing that interface as articulated with Drucker as a 'zone of encounter provoking probabilistic production' resembled more the face to face than it does the facade of art/media. Now that I think of it, thanks to Rothko, maybe the difference between face and facade is indeed proximity? Not simply a nearness such as Rothko's urging to stand close to his works to be enveloped in a way such that the viewer does not command the piece, but a spatiality that allows for contact without grasp. A facade invites consumption and tourism, while the face demands an encounter that can not be reduced to observation. The face as encounter has depth, which creates a space that allows for both distance and nearness, where the distance consistently interrupts the impulse to draw near (appear). Perhaps we could call this the space of the asymptotic relation? 

Simon Critchley, in his work on the relationship between ethics and politics, "Infinitely Demanding," argues for a similar kind of spatiality in political anarchism. Tracing Levinas's use of anarchy in the "Substitution" section of OTB, Critchley moves from anarchy through obsession and persecution to "interstitial distance" (Critchley 2007, 121-23). For Critchley, this is already a move from the ethical to the political, with interstitial distance being a distance from AND within the state that consistently resists the tendency of the State^[I capitalize State here both to follow the convention used by Critchley and to signal the tendency of State to operate as an arche or governing principle.] to order all areas of life by collapsing the distance of multiplicity into the facade of unity (Critchley 2007, 112-13). 

A facade as flat reminds me of the distinction N Katherine Hayles makes in her essay "Print is Flat, Code is Deep: The Importance of Media Specific Analysis" (Hayles 2004). 

I will begin with a look at the role of anarchy as challenging the reign of an origin or principle in Levinas. Then I will trace the connection between anarchy and proximity. Finally, we will explore the ways in which proximity as contact without grasp offers a mode of probabilistic production in the practice of reading, thus how proximity can shape our interface design.

Anarchy is a loaded term and can mean many things. Contrary to some initial impressions of both my work and my person, I am not the least interested in a simple notion of anarchy as chaos or disorder. Along the lines of Levinas, I exploit the variability of the semantic range of αρχη in Greek and use an-archic to denote a practice of meaning making without recourse to the *reign* of an *original* (See Simon Critchley with Peter Atterton and Graham Noctor translating Levinas, [*Basic Philosophical Writings*](http://amzn.com/0253210798), 81). Levinasian proximity as an anarchic encounter with the face of the other will offer questions toward the role of bible in shaping nonconsumptive (ethical) reading practices.

When I speak of anarchy, I mean something other than a generic absence of order or a simple negation of rule, origin, or principle. Insofar as chaos is connected to the emergent properties of complex dynamic systems, I have no problem with chaos as a fecund space, loaded with potential for meaning. Yet, shaped by my encounters with the writings of Emmanuel Levinas, something deeper and more subtle is at work in my sense of the gravity of anarchy. Exploiting the koine semantic range of αρχη, which can mean beginning and reign, I hear the an-archic as that which is *without the reign of an original*.

### Levinas and anarchy

Though the role of the anarchic in the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas doesn't blossom until the inclusion of Substitution as the core essay in *Otherwise Than Being*, we can see anarchy at work in many of Levinas's writings. In Existents and Existence...

There is a way in which I am arguing for interface as disinterested nonindifference - disinterested in that it is not engaged in absorbing and thematizing, nonindifferent because it is participatory.^[This might be more than I want to argue, since the nonindifferent demands the face and ethics.]

Levinas's essay, "Substitution," has a manuscript tradition of its own that
offers us an object lesson in the anarchic as "without the reign of an
original." In the introduction to the first English translation of an early
version of the essay, Bernasconi narrates the life of "Substitution" in
[*Emmanuel Levinas: Basic Philosophical Writings*](), p. 79.

Here are three versions of a section of this essay, the french of the later
iteration of the essay in *Autrement qu'être*, it's English translation by
Alphonso Lingis in *Otherwise than Being*, and the English translation of the
1968 version of the essay translated by Simon Critchley, Peter Atterton, and
Graham Noctor. Which is the original? Does it matter?

Philosophical Writings*, 81

Instead of worrying about which of these moments in the life of this essay is
closest to some originary articulation of these ideas from Levinas in his 1967
lecture, can we read them together, an-archically, "as disequilibrium, as
delirium, undoing thematization, eluding *principle*, origin, and will, or
αρχη...*Mouvement, dans le sense originel du terme, an-archique*." 
> I have intentionally created a mashup quote using bits from each of these fragments as a practice of anarchic reading. 

Isn't it interesting that a discussion of the anarchic as eluding or escaping origin points to *le sense originel du terme*? In a way, this contradiction, using the *original* sense of the word an-arche to articulate a methodology that does not privilege an origin or principle, is precisely the point. As Simon Critchley notes in his collection of lectures *The Problem with Levinas*, it is important for Levinas that anarchy does not simply become another arche or simply a different kind of order (Critchley 2015, 70-73). Though Critchley tries to argue for a link between anarchy in Levinas and political anarchism in his book *Infinitely Demanding*, he makes it clear that this link is a critical extension of Levinas not found in Levinas's writings themselves. Connecting the two Greek meanings of the word arche, Critchley says, "Anarchy cannot, therefore, be a new ordering principle, a new arkhê. It cannot reign. It can only take place as the disruption of order and not a new order" (Critchley 2015, 72). In his own writing about writing books, Levinas makes this point about the necessary difficulty or "fine risk" of writing about anarchy. He says, "Language is nevertheless able to speak of it [the very enigmatic anarchy which is the face], thereby confirming the impossibility of the an-archic constituting itself as a sovereignty, whence the very noncondition of anarchy. Yet the hold of language over the anarchic is not a mastery, for otherwise anarchy would be subordinated to the arche of consciousness" (Levinas, "Substitution," Basic Philosophical Writings, 91 note 34). 
> There is another place where he defends his writing of books in light of avoiding anarchy becoming an arche. Note 19 on p 195-6 of OTB is in the direction, but not quite what I remember. this note may be another iteration of the note from the earlier version of Substitution cited above. I wonder if it would be instructive to reflect also on his famous quote about books here?

>that I am also struck by the potential poetic movement of *délire de lire* in our exploration of the cultural production of bible.

Despite the semantic negation built into the word an-archy, I am uninterested in arguing for the absence of original. In my early attempts to articulate this anarchy in the realm of translation studies through a talk titled "From Murder to Anarchy" at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014, I fear I had fallen into the trap of archaizing the anarchic by arguing for the eradication of the notion of original in the process of translation. The conversations with translators who have spent their lives caring for and working with both biblical and literary texts taught me that we needn't eschew the presence, value, and operation of an original or source text in the process of translation in order to question said original's governance over the validity or even methodology of a translation. We can always construct an original given a particular data set and time frame. Instead of eradicating any notion of original, I am asking us to consider a kind of reading, a mode of making, that operates *without the reign of an original*. In this vein, anarchy becomes one mechanism for the probabilistic production offered by interfaces that we discussed in chapter 1.

### proximity: encounter without grasp (proximity in Levinas) texts/books are
not anarchic, but interfaces can afford anarchy in reading practices - anarchy is afforded in an encounter, not a property, thus the important of proximity

### examples: Benjamin (literary montage)
Walter Benjamin is well know for struggling with a major technological transition from manual to mechanical reproduction of art as the world embarked on its Second World War. In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (Benjamin 1936), Benjamin seems to lament the loss of "aura" in a work of art when mechanically reproduced by film in particular. This notion of aura in Benjamin is notoriously complicated, but at the risk of oversimplification, we can see how aura operates as an origin or originating principle for Benjamin as he reflects on the value and production of art. For Benjamin, there seems to be a loss of aura in the new technological age of mechanical reproduction, and though not entirely clear, we can find a somewhat mournful tone in his discussion of this loss. [^Find a few secondary sources like Brent plate and a media theorist, who offer discussions of the operation of aura in Benjamin.]

In his later work, which actually never gets "finished" in a format familiar to scholars, Benjamin seems to embrace a productive process that bothers the reign of originating principle such as intent or aura. *The Arcades Project* follows a methodology Benjamin calls "literary montage," which he describes as "" (Benjamin 1940??). As plate suggests, this methodology is not just a compositional strategy but an attempt to reimagine history anarchically, history not governed by the tyranny of a return to origins. *Arcades project* performs this methodology beautifully, resisting the need to order artifacts according to an authorial intent that would guide the reader in their appropriate consumption of the content. Instead, *Arcades Project* offers an interfAce, a zone of encounter, that affords anarchy by allowing the reader to encounter artifacts without governing their grasp.

?? Though this interrupts the alliteration, I wonder if my argument is actually that interfaces afford proximity, which in turn encourages a disposition toward anarchy, reading practices not governed by an original, principle, or theme.

### De Certeau (never a blank page),

### Parker (living text of Gospels)

Being formed in my teen age and early adult years by evangelical christian culture, the committment to original intent and original manuscript autographs as the arbitrer of meaning was deeply ingrained. The possibility of bible as simulacrum or as anything other than the witness to the originary divine revelation made no sense in this culture. If this doxa was questioned within my evangelical community, it was met with a socially acceptable means of excommunication. In an early doctoral seminar on paleography and text criticism, I was exposed to David Parker's book, The Living Text of the Gospels. Parker was one of the first serious textualists to challenge my notion of original as the "real" or as the metanarrative legitimating meaning as we read these texts. In general, Parker uses variation within the manuscript tradition of early christian texts that would come to make up what we call the bible today, particularly gospel manuscripts, to suggest that gospels are a tradition, not a law. During an analysis of variations in manuscripts regarding Jesus's comments on marriage and divorce, Parker says, "The quest for a Law in the teachings of Jesus cannot be pursued in the face "of the evidence that, for those early Christians who passed the tradition to "us, there was--no law, but a tradition whose meaning had to be kept alive by "reflection and reinterpretation (Parker, Living Text, 93).

Parker suggests that with the gospel tradition, meaning is practiced, not
dictated by or excavated from an original. In his own nod to a preference for
genealogy over archaeology, relationship over lineage, Parker suggests,

"The attempt to discern earlier forms of a text , from which those known to us
"are descended, is an essential task in the critical study of Christian
"origins.  It does not follow that it is also necessary to recover a single
"original text (Parker, Living Text, 208).

Though I find his idea of the study of Christian origins a bit ironic in the
context of his anarchic notion of the biblical tradition, I admire his
willingness to question the doxa of the original text while still holding a
deep sense of meaning possibilities in the gospel tradition. He helped open a
world for me. He altered my habitus by offering a new set of possibilities to
shape my dispositions, by begging questions i couldn't even yet imagine.

Taking a very different approach, Tim Beal in *The Rise and Fall of the Bible*, also raises some questions that challenge the cultural notions of bible and book. Driven in part by a curiosity around the continued rise in bible production and sales alongside what seems to be a decline in biblical literacy in America (QUOTE), Beal questions our typical ingrained notions of the relationship between literary production and consumption. He suggests that the meaning and value of the bible in America may have little to do with the accessibility and relevance of the texts inside these books that carry on the ancient manuscript tradition. Instead, it is the cultural iconicity of the bible that generates its value and meaning. Perhaps this cultural iconicity is akin to the reality principle that Baudrillard talks about in Disneyland? People buy bibles not because they actually think they will find some original meaning in these ancient texts that will be relevant to their contemporary life, but because the cultural idea of bible offers a promise that "truth" or "reality" still exist. No doubt, Beal is on to something when he suggests that this cultural idea of bible as a locus of singular and univocal truth is bound up in the codex technologies that came to hold in one volume the entire libraries that constituted the various community collections that were called scrolls but came to be know as bible (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location, 2032-46). In so far as this cultural idea of bible prevails, the bible as stable truth or "the real," the cultural value of the bible is married to the the cultural vlaue placed on the codex. Yet, the codex is losing its grip on the reality principle with the advent of e-books, cloud collections, and searchability that gives us new "books" made up of fragments from many sources and with little regard for their location in their "original" narratives. How will the cultural iconicity of the bible fare in this new marketplace?

Like Parker, Beal too problematizes the dominant conception of the bible as a
singular book with a stable original. Interestingly, both authors make this
argument using the cultural capital valued in the bible context, antiquity,
which can easily slide into a sense of recovering an original. Nonetheless,
Beal describes the early manuscript tradition of the bible as a collection of
texts from many sources and many contexts that "were not the same from copy to
copy. There was no beginning and no end to them, no first and last page. They
did not have one author or one voice. They were not read in a linear way, but
they were read around in. And they grew through interpretation" (Beal, Rise
and Fall, 2046). Beal offers this imagination of the bible as a multivocal,
polyvalent and dynamic library to challenge the doxa of the bible as "the
literal Word of God and closed book of answers" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2032).
Just before this quote, Beal suggests that this cultural imagination of bible
as reality principle is already dead, so he goes on to articulate an
alternative imagination of the bible as "a space that hosts accidental
revelation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location 2060), an infinite cycle of
production littered with intrigue and surprise as meaning is made in practice.
