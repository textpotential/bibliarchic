# CHAPTER 2: AFFORDING ANARCHY

With the help of Johanna Drucker's call to humanities scholars to attend to interface design, we have seen that book as interface provokes probabilistic production in a reading event. Even as we have moved beyond any notion of interface as static surface or as container for content, we still have the imperative to design and analyze interfaces to encourage a set of dispositions that would support the provocation of probabilistic production in reading practice. Drucker offers several suggestions in this direction at the end of her piece on the Humanities and Interface Theory (Drucker 2011, ??). In this chapter I will advocate for one particular disposition for us to consider in our design of bible as interface. This disposition is anarchy, reading practices not governed by an original text or singular unifying principle. 

How would an interface encourage such a disposition toward anarchy? Interfaces on their own, as with all technologies, do not propagate dispositions or values. Technologies do not define or determine us. Rather, it is our *relationship with* interfaces that *afford* the encouragement of dispositions. In no way do I mean to suggest that interfaces or other technologies are neutral with respect to values.^[A note here about my dissatisfaction with Richard Cohen's Levinasian analysis of the ethics of new media in conversation with Introna and Turkle.] I am simply reiterating Drucker's point that interface is a zone of encounter, where meaning is made through the indeterminate yet constrained entanglement of physical space and user participation. Affordances offer a way of talking about our relationships with and participation in the physical spaces of interface. 

## Introducing Affordance ##

Affordances were first introduced in by James J. Gibson, a perceptual psychologist, in 1977 in an article titled "The Theory of Affordances" (Gibson 1977). Gibson expands on this theory in his 1979 book, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*, where he offers the definition "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??). An important aspect of Gibson's invention of affordances is their relational nature. An affordance is the relationship between the physical properties of a "surface" and an organism encountering that surface (Gibson 1979, ??). 

Taking Gibson's lead, I will offer an example using codex as a surface engaged or used by a reader.^[Gibson's example is the relationship between an animal and a terrestrial surface. See Gibson 1979, ??.] The physical properties of a codex include flexible pages bound together on one long side with a cover on the front and back. The pages have writing on them. This codex *affords* reading for the reader. More specifically, the codex affords non-linear access to text because of the physical properties of binding on one side and flexible pages instead of being rolled up in one long sheet from one end to the other as in a scroll. This is simply one example of the relationship between physical properties of space and the affordances offered in the relationship with a "user."

The critical piece of Gibson's theory is the relational nature of affordances and the way affordances problematize the binary between subject and object (Gibson 1979, ??). An affordance is not simply a property of an object or of a subject. Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant. This sounds a good bit like an interface. Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibility sets offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface. ^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition at reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that is the reading event.

## Affordance and Interface ##

One limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavior capacities of an organism. In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance. Donald Norman brought Gibson's notion of affordances into the world of human-computer interface design and focused the concept on those actions "perceived" as possible or likely by a user of an interface by combining the operations of affordances, signifiers, and constraints (Norman 2013, 145). Rather than exploring any action made possible by the relationship between the physical properties of an interface and the capacities of a user, Norman focused more on the possibility sets that would make sense to a user when encountering an interface.^[In the first chapter of the revised and expanded edition of *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman tells the story of his relationship with Gibson and their fundamental disagreements about the interpretive role of the brain in the relationship between agents and objects (Norman 2013, 12). Norman is clear about his indebtedness to Gibson and the important contribution Gibson made to helping designers pay more attention to the information offered by the physical world.] 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14). If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user. Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces. The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14). Understandably, Norman is focused on intuitive and useful interface design, with primarily the designer in mind, so introducing the property of a signifier to help designers talk about what they are adding to an interface to point to an affordance makes good sense. Yet, one of the reasons I will stay closer to the more generic notion of affordances as we discuss bible as interface is to distance our design and analysis of interfaces from the singular intent of the "appropriate" or "proper" use of an interface as determined by the designer. In Norman's definiton of signifer, we can see this emphasis on the proper at work. He says, "For me, the term *signifier* refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a user" (Norman 2013, 14). This signifer as indicator of "appropriate behavior" is different than an affordance, which is the possible relationships between a surface and an agent. Now, Norman does allow for accidental or unintentional signifiers, which maintains some semblance of our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] Yet, his emphasis on understandability as connected to the communication of "appropriate behavior" could lead toward design governed by determining mechanistic consumption rather than provoking probabilistic production. 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints. Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural. Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76). In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145). I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained. 

Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface. Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions. Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*. Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??). **More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

Gaver extends Norman's use of affordances into 3 categories, perceived, hidden and false (Gaver 1991). Though Gaver seems to move back toward affordances as properties rather than relationships, he does offer some insights into using affordances to evaluate the suitability of interfaces, which may help us later on as we use N. Katherine Hayles's media specific analysis to evaluate a few interfaces and their affordance of anarchy or lack thereof.

I provide this long introduction to affordance theory as a way toward imagining the proximity of the face in Levinas as an interface which affords anarchy. First, we need to consider the possibility of proximity as interface, a zone of encounter that provokes probabilistic production. 

## Proximity as Interface ##

For Drucker, an interface creates a space that allows for a depth of encounter, not simply the contact of a surface. Similarly for Levinas, the face to face creates a space that allows for encounter that holds together nearness and distance, which he calls proximity. I will argue that the proximity of the face in Levinas's philosophy creates something like an interface that affords anarchy. We will use the operations of proximity as interface to guide our explorations of the possibilities for designing reading interfaces that afford anarchy. 

There are two reasons why I bring Levinas's proximity of the face into the conversation of bible as interface at this point. First, Levinas's proximity of the face provides a helpful way to articulate spaces of encounter that encourage a disposition toward anarchy, challenging the reign of the original or fundamental principle. Second, as we trace some possible affinities between proximity and interface, our interface design can be infused with and informed by a philosophy of human relating that is not reducible to that which we can understand or contain.

The concept of proximity has been taken up in the area of internet communication technologies (ICTs) as community has been reconstituted through our ability to interact and relate across vast geographic, temporal, and cultural distances. Lucas Introna offers a nice summary of the common discussions of proximity, distance, and community in his SEP entry on "Phenomenological Approaches to the Ethics of Information Technology" (Introna 2011).

HAND on Proximity - So the term proximity indicates something excessive for Levinas. It signi fi es a community that exists before any established fact, where the other ’ s singularity is experienced by me as unparalleled, overwhelming, extreme, exclusive and pre-assigned. There is simply no choice in the matter.

-- This excessiveness is highlighted nicely in Ethics as First Philosophy from Hand reader 82-83 - "The proximity of the other is the face's meaning, and it means from the very start in a way that goes beyond those plastic forms which forever try to cover the face like a mask of their presence to perception. But always the face shows through these forms."
-- This is a direct reflection on Introna's discussion of community and proximity in the SEP article. Here, Hand suggests that proximity does indicate a kind of community for Levinas, but not a community dependent upon any pre-existing horizon. I wonder if community here is a helpful term? Here, I think the phrase contact without grasp fits proximity well. Before even our perceptual faculties are constructed in the relational act, there is an encounter that precedes and exceeds my ability to grasp or make sense of or choose it and demands a response, a responsibility, that then provides the conditions of possibility for a relationality. Introna helps greatly ion seeing where the notion of proximity may come from Heidegger's notion of disclosure and close at hand. Yet, and critically yet, for Levinas, proximity is not reducible to disclosure or shared horizon. It is contact without grasp or even contact that is being grasped? As Hand suggests, proximity exceeds horizon and disclosure. 

My goal here is to connect the notions of proximity and anarchy in Levinas to interface design that affords reading which is not primarily governed by consuming the content of a container, but encourages a space of interaction that supports difference. Just as Drucker offers probabilistic production as an alternative to mechanical determinism, so here, I will offer the anarchy of proximity as an alternative to consumptive mastery in the practice of reading. Not only does bible offer a zone of encounter for provoking probabilistic production in the practice of reading, but, I argue, bible can be an *anarchic interface*, an interface not governed by a singular original, theme, or principle. Extending Levinas's description of the pre-conscious ethical encounter in the face to face as proximity, I will operationalize this proximity in interface design as a space with depth that opens up possibility for contact without grasp, thus reading not governed by an original (an-arche). 

As I mentioned in the beginning of my chapter on interface, it was in part the simple semantic correlation between inter-face and the face to face in Levinas that raised my curiosity about the possible relationship between the proximity at work in the face to face and bible as interface. One way to parse this process in Levinas's writings is that the face initiates a proximity, a zone of encounter (recall Drucker's discussion of interface) that is both near and distant, which in turn affords anarchic relations, relations not governed by one subject's ability to comprehend, understand, or categorize another subject. So, in the ethical relation, the proximity of the face creates an interface, a particular kind of zone of encounter that demands contact without grasp. Here, I am suggesting a close relationship between the provocation of probabilistic production characteristic of interface and the proximity of the face in the ethical encounter.

For me what matters most in this entire exploration of proximity is its challenge to mastery as the ground for humanness, relationship, and meaning. In proximity, meaning precedes and conditions my mastery of either the physical environment or any other participant in an interface. This is the idea in Levinas's suggestion that even words co-exist before they are coordinated. There is a contact that is not consumption which provides the space of possibility for human connection and interaction, interface. See this quote from Hand -- Levinas’s appreciation of Celan, in contrast, emphasizes the poverty, inadequacy and non-radiance of a language, a language that therefore signifies proximity rather than mastery, and a being for the other rather than a world in being.

Only occurring about a dozen times in Levinas's first major philosophical work, *Totality and Infinity*, proximity comes to the fore in *Otherwise Than Being*, occurring well over 200 times. From a basic search in the Hand Levinas Reader, we can also see the concept of proximity operative in many of Levinas's writings outside the two major philosophical works. His late reflections on the poetry of Paul Celan will offer us a way toward exploring proximity in Levinas. I begin here with Levinas on Celan to make explicit the connections between proximity in Levinas as a response to the dominance of unconcealing in Heidegger's philosophy, which also undergirds his famous reflections on the relationship between humans and technology. Sean Hand, in his exquisite reflections on the life and work of Levinas highlights the way in which Levinas sees in Celan a contrast to Heideggerian readings of the poetry of Hölderlin. Hand writes, "Levinas’s appreciation of Celan, in contrast, emphasizes the poverty, inadequacy and non-radiance of a language, a language that therefore signifies proximity rather than mastery, and a being for the other rather than a world in being" (Hand 2008). It is this difference between Levinas and Heidegger that drives the importance of proximity in Levinas's work and this difference between proximity and mastery that draws my reflections on interface toward the work of Levinas.

There is another important reason why I begin with Levinas on Celan. In most of Levinas's early work, he is clearly focused only on the possibility of the ethical relation among humans. He explicitly argues against things having a face in his early work on art in Reality and its Shadows. Things simply do not have the dynamism or the vulnerability of the human face and hence do not command, "Thou Shall Not Kill" in the same way. With these later reflections on Celan's poetry as "a language of and for proximity," we begin to see Levinas allow for art to participate in the "otherwise than being" that is his ethical relation. Now, the role of affordances in interface as we have discussed here could offer a way to imagine how the face might remain a distinctively human phenomenon and yet art may still be able to participate in proximity. Perhaps a book or a painting or a poem, in the case of Celan, or any interface can not be the face of the other since it can not demand the same kind of responsibility. Yet, these interfaces can offer a kind of proximity that conditions a disposition toward the ethical relation? accept that the ethical relation is pre-dispositional, so this last bit doesn't work. 

Proximity appears^[I am aware of the difficult irony of this phrase, since I am arguing for proximity as an alternative to the appearing that is so central to Heidegger's philosophical system.] in Levinas's own reflections on Celan in an essay titled "Being and the Other: On Paul Celan" (Levinas and Melville 1978). In the brief introduction to Levinas's reading of Celan on poetry, we find the contrast between the unveiling aletheia ("truth of Being") in Heidegger and the proximity in Levinas that is responsibility for the other, contact without grasp. Describing his understanding of Celan's view, Levinas writes that poetic language is "A language of and for proximity--more ancient than that of the "truth of Being" (which it probably bears and supports), the first of languages--response preceding question, responsibility to the neighbor--, making possible through its "for the other" the whole miracle of giving (Levinas and Melville 1978, 17). In this simple excerpt from Levinas's reflections on Celan, we see proximity preceding truth and response(ibility) preceding questioning. Here we have the explicit connection Levinas makes between his concept of proximity and Celan's notion of poetic language. Near the end of this essay on Celan, Levinas also suggests that Celan poetry is an "otherwise than Being," which again draws the parallels between his philosophical reflections and Celan's poetic art. 

My task here is not to explicate or argue comprehensively for Levinas's views on poetry, art, or Celan in particular.^[Provide a list of some people who do take up this questions explicitly, beginning with Hand's summary of early and late views of art and then some more specific studies that contrast "Reality and It's Shadows" with "Being and the Other: On Paul Celan."] Instead, I will use the threads in this essay on Celan to frame proximity as a response to the unconcealing that is essential to Heidegger's understanding of human relationship with technology. In particular, "Being and the Other" offers several hints toward the link between proximity and something otherwise than (and containing) the "truth of Being" in Heidegger. Along with his explicit mention of Heidegger on the first page of the essay, Levinas frames Celan's notion of poetic language as not "the shining forth of pre-Socratic '*physis*,'" but as "prior to 'unconcealment,'" a language "more ancient than that of the 'truth of Being,'" and "response preceding question" (Levinas and Melville 1978, 16-17). All four of these concepts, the shining forth of physis, unconcealment, the truth of Being, and the importance of questioning are direct references to Heidegger's philosophical framework. 

Though we could use many of Heidegger's writings to trace the operations of these concepts, I will focus on his famous essay translated into English as "The Question Concerning Technology" (QCT from here on; Heidegger and TRANS 1977). In this context, I choose QCT because I am focused on the technologies of reading in interface and this essay of Heidegger's has been a critical piece of the historical conversation about human relationships with machines. Also, in QCT, Heidegger demonstrates his reading of Hölderlin's poetry toward his philosophy of appearing/revealing, which Levinas is directly contrasting in his reading of Celan's poetry. Truth as a revealing plays a central part in Heidegger's "questioning" of technology and the essay ends with a turn to art and a celebration of "questioning."  

QCT is a revised version of the second of a four part lecture series Heidegger gave in Bremen in 1949 as his first public address after the war ended (Blitz 2014). The larger lecture series explores the changing relationship between distance and nearness with the rise of modern technologies. I will argue that proximity in Levinas is in part a response to Heidegger's reflections on nearness, distance, and human encounter. The core problem Heidegger identifies with technology in QCT is quite related to the concerns I have already discussed in Johanna Drucker's questioning of the mechanistic determinism of interface design in the software industry and my own concerns about common notions of reader as consumer of content in a container. Through what Heidegger calls enframing or positioning (Gestell), a technological kind of unconcealing, all things are reduced to interchangeable resources that can be leveraged as needed for efficiency and production. Even in the realm of science, technology has made nature into "standing reserve," simply a set of resources ready for use. It is not the framing of the potential problems with technology and its impact on human relationship that differentiates Heidegger from Levinas here. Both thinkers raise concern about processes or theories that commodify humans. Rather, they differ in their proposed solutions to these commodifying tendencies. Heidegger, in direct response to the technologizing of society, turns to poetry as art, which offers a different kind of unconcealing than that of technology, but an unconcealing all the same. One way to restate this suggestion by Heidegger is as a change in masters. HOW IS THIS UNCONCEALING STILL AN ERADICATION OF DIFFERENCE? Levinas, not taking up the problem of technology explicitly, proposes a mode of human relationship that he finds performed in Celan's poetry, which can not be reduced to mastery or appearance, but instead operates as a responsibility he calls a language of and for proximity. 

Contextualizing the role of proximity in this way as something before and beyond the revealing that is central for Heidegger, we can begin to see two resonances of the term proximate at work in Levinas. The clearest sense of proximity is as a problematization of the distance/nearness spatial binary, where both nearness and distance are maintained in a process of "approach" that is as characterized by concealing as it is revealing. With the connection between revealing and truth in Heidegger, I can't help but also hear proximity as a suggestion of the ap*proximate* nature of encounter that is "for the other." The truth of Being as a revealing in a horizon of Being gives us access to things as they are, a mastery of sorts. Proximity, by contrast, promises the impossibility of mastery, always an approximation due to the infinite interruption of the other's demand on me.  

Now, with this conversation in the background, we can take a close look at a few examples of how proximity works in Levinas's philosophical framework. 

> Saying is not a game. Anteced- ent to the verbal signs it conjugates, to the linguistic systems and the semantic glimmerings, a foreword preceding languages, it is the proximity of one to the other, the commitment of an approach, the one for the other, the very signifyingness of signification. (But is approach to be defined by commitment, and not rather commitment by approach? (Levinas OTB, 6)


Perhaps the Saying offers an more accessible (pun intended) way to get at the operation of proximity in both Levinas and in my theory of interface. Hand quotes Levinas saying - "Saying is 'the commitment of an approach, the one for the other, the very signifyingness of signication,6 prior to being a communication in which a truth is manifested. Saying therefore breaks through the noema involved in intentionality, stripping me in extreme passivity of every identical quiddity. Subjectivity is the dis-interested vulnerability of saying." (Hand Reader, 6).

### Proximity and Distance ###

If Levinas describes the encounter of the face to face using proximity, and if proximity is contact without grasp, then we can see the analogy between proximity and the probabilistic production involved in interface. Further, Drucker helpfully reminds us that interfaces "provoke" this other kind of encounter that resists mechanistic (i.e. determinative) consumption of content in a container and opens to a making that involves the possibility of surprise. Though the language is stronger in Levinas, the face too "provokes" a kind of encounter that is other than deterministic consumption, this material encounter, Levinas describes as proximity. Proximity, then, is another way of describing the probabilistic production at work in a reading event in the space that is interface.

## Without the Reign of an Original ##

As a student of bible for much of my life, in personal practice or scholarly pursuit, the reign of αρχη has dominated both my concept of textual tradition and any notion of manuscript awareness. The archic logocentrism of my evangelical exegetical training became immediately apparent in the first verse we learned to read in Greek - εν αρχη ην ο λογος (John 1.1). It is αρχη and all of its resonances with the *beginning* of LXX Genesis that signals the reign of λογος in a Christian interpretive tradition that claims to take the verbal character of *the* bible seriously as divine revelation. Couple this with the tenth article of the [1978 Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy](http://library.dts.edu/Pages/TL/Special/ICBI_1.pdf), which links inspiration and "the [λογος] of God" with the *original, autographic text of Scripture*, and we can see the deep archic sensibilities of the tradition in which I was reared, even at the material manuscript level.

It took David Parker's careful questioning of this αρχη or original of the manuscript tradition in [*The Living Text of the Gospels*]() to awaken me to the anarchy at work even in the materiality of bible. Yet, Parker never invokes the language of anarchy. Aware of the ancient Greek semantic potential of αρχη, Emmanuel Levinas, another close reader of biblical texts and tradition, introduced me to an anarchy that was something beyond disorder as another order and something significantly more complicated than the simple absence of a beginning or origin. In his essay titled "Substitution," Levinas takes up the relationship between proximity and the αρχη. At many points in this project, we will struggle with the potential of proximity, from spatial nearness and distance to ap-proximat-ion to a notion of contact without grasp. But for now, we will focus on the anarchic.

I wonder if a note here or a paragraph on the difference between face and facade in Levinas (Reality and it's Shadow) as it relates to interface. It is my experience that many address new media interfaces as a facade, partly indebted to the Frankfurt school's devaluation of mass media. I am arguing that interface as articulated with Drucker as a 'zone of encounter provoking probabilistic production' resembled more the face to face than it does the facade of art/media. Now that I think of it, thanks to Rothko, maybe the difference between face and facade is indeed proximity? Not simply a nearness such as Rothko's urging to stand close to his works to be enveloped in a way such that the viewer does not command the piece, but a spatiality that allows for contact without grasp. A facade invites consumption and tourism, while the face demands an encounter that can not be reduced to observation. The face as encounter has depth, which creates a space that allows for both distance and nearness, where the distance consistently interrupts the impulse to draw near (appear). Perhaps we could call this the space of the asymptotic relation? 

A facade as flat reminds me of the distinction N Katherine Hayles makes in her essay "Print is Flat, Code is Deep: The Importance of Media Specific Analysis" (Hayles 2004). 

Simon Critchley, in his work on the relationship between ethics and politics, "Infinitely Demanding," argues for a similar kind of spatiality in political anarchism. Tracing Levinas's use of anarchy in the "Substitution" section of OTB, Critchley moves from anarchy through obsession and persecution to "interstitial distance" (Critchley 2007, 121-23). For Critchley, this is already a move from the ethical to the political, with interstitial distance being a distance from AND within the state that consistently resists the tendency of the State^[I capitalize State here both to follow the convention used by Critchley and to signal the tendency of State to operate as an arche or governing principle.] to order all areas of life by collapsing the distance of multiplicity into the facade of unity (Critchley 2007, 112-13). 

When I speak of anarchy, I mean something other than a generic absence of order or a simple negation of rule, origin, or principle. Insofar as chaos is connected to the emergent properties of complex dynamic systems, I have no problem with chaos as a fecund space, loaded with potential for meaning. Yet, shaped by my encounters with the writings of Emmanuel Levinas, something deeper and more subtle is at work in my sense of the gravity of anarchy. Exploiting the koine semantic range of αρχη, which can mean beginning and reign, I hear the an-archic as that which is *without the reign of an original*.

Levinas's essay, "Substitution," has a manuscript tradition of its own that offers us an object lesson in the anarchic as "without the reign of an original." In the introduction to the first English translation of an early version of the essay, Bernasconi narrates the life of "Substitution" in [*Emmanuel Levinas: Basic Philosophical Writings*](), p. 79.

Here are three versions of a section of this essay, the french of the later iteration of the essay in *Autrement qu'être*, it's English translation by Alphonso Lingis in *Otherwise than Being*, and the English translation of the 1968 version of the essay translated by Simon Critchley, Peter Atterton, and Graham Noctor. Which is the original? Does it matter?

image 1^[Alphonso Lingis translating Emmanuel Levinas, *Otherwise than Being*, 100-101.]
image 2^[Emmanuel Levinas, *Autrement qu'être*, 158-160.]
image 3^[Critchley, Atterton, and Noctor translating Levinas, *Emmanuel Levinas: Basic Philosophical Writings*, 81]

Instead of worrying about which of these moments in the life of this essay is closest to some originary articulation of these ideas from Levinas in his 1967 lecture, can we read them together, an-archically, "as disequilibrium, as delirium, undoing thematization, eluding *principle*, origin, and will, or αρχη...*Mouvement, dans le sense originel du terme, an-archique*."

> I have intentionally created a mashup quote using bits from each of these fragments as a practice of anarchic reading. 

Isn't it interesting that a discussion of the anarchic as eluding or escaping origin points to *le sense originel du terme*? In a way, this contradiction, using the *original* sense of the word an-arche to articulate a methodology that does not privilege an origin or principle, is precisely the point. As Simon Critchley notes in his collection of lectures *The Problem with Levinas*, it is important for Levinas that anarchy does not simply become another arche or simply a different kind of order (Critchley 2015, 70-73). Though Critchley tries to argue for a link between anarchy in Levinas and political anarchism in his book *Infinitely Demanding*, he makes it clear that this link is a critical extension of Levinas not found in Levinas's writings themselves. Connecting the two Greek meanings of the word arche, Critchley says, "Anarchy cannot, therefore, be a new ordering principle, a new arkhê. It cannot reign. It can only take place as the disruption of order and not a new order" (Critchley 2015, 72). In his own writing about writing books, Levinas makes this point about the necessary difficulty or "fine risk" of writing about anarchy. He says, "Language is nevertheless able to speak of it [the very enigmatic anarchy which is the face], thereby confirming the impossibility of the an-archic constituting itself as a sovereignty, whence the very noncondition of anarchy. Yet the hold of language over the anarchic is not a mastery, for otherwise anarchy would be subordinated to the arche of consciousness" (Levinas, "Substitution," Basic Philosophical Writings, 91 note 34). 

> There is another place where he defends his writing of books in light of avoiding anarchy becoming an arche. Note 19 on p 195-6 of OTB is in the direction, but not quite what I remember. this note may be another iteration of the note from the earlier version of Substitution cited above. I wonder if it would be instructive to reflect also on his famous quote about books here?

>that I am also struck by the potential poetic movement of *délire de lire* in our exploration of the cultural production of bible.

Despite the semantic negation built into the word an-archy, I am uninterested in arguing for the absence of original. In my early attempts to articulate this anarchy in the realm of translation studies through a talk titled "From Murder to Anarchy" at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014, I fear I had fallen into the trap of archaizing the anarchic by arguing for the eradication of the notion of original in the process of translation. The conversations with translators who have spent their lives caring for and working with both biblical and literary texts taught me that we needn't eschew the presence, value, and operation of an original or source text in the process of translation in order to question said original's governance over the validity or even methodology of a translation. We can always construct an original given a particular data set and time frame. Instead of eradicating any notion of original, I am asking us to consider a kind of reading, a mode of making, that operates *without the reign of an original*. In this vein, anarchy becomes one mechanism for the probabilistic production offered by interfaces that we discussed in chapter 1.

## Anarchic Readings ##

### Walter Benjamin - Literary Montage) ###

Walter Benjamin is well know for struggling with a major technological transition from manual to mechanical reproduction of art as the world embarked on its Second World War. In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (Benjamin 1936), Benjamin seems to lament the loss of "aura" in a work of art when mechanically reproduced by film in particular. This notion of aura in Benjamin is notoriously complicated, but at the risk of oversimplification, we can see how aura operates as an origin or originating principle for Benjamin as he reflects on the value and production of art. For Benjamin, there seems to be a loss of aura in the new technological age of mechanical reproduction, and though not entirely clear, we can find a somewhat mournful tone in his discussion of this loss. ^[Find a few secondary sources like Brent plate and a media theorist, who offer discussions of the operation of aura in Benjamin.]

In his later work, which actually never gets "finished" in a format familiar to scholars, Benjamin seems to embrace a productive process that bothers the reign of originating principle such as intent or aura. *The Arcades Project* follows a methodology Benjamin calls "literary montage," which he describes as "" (Benjamin 1940??). As plate suggests, this methodology is not just a compositional strategy but an attempt to reimagine history anarchically, history not governed by the tyranny of a return to origins. *Arcades project* performs this methodology beautifully, resisting the need to order artifacts according to an authorial intent that would guide the reader in their appropriate consumption of the content. Instead, *Arcades Project* offers an interfAce, a zone of encounter, that affords anarchy by allowing the reader to encounter artifacts without governing their grasp.

### Parker - Living Text of Gospels ###

Being formed in my teen age and early adult years by evangelical christian culture, the committment to original intent and original manuscript autographs as the arbitrer of meaning was deeply ingrained. The possibility of bible as simulacrum or as anything other than the witness to the originary divine revelation made no sense in this culture. If this doxa was questioned within my evangelical community, it was met with a socially acceptable means of excommunication. In an early doctoral seminar on paleography and text criticism, I was exposed to David Parker's book, The Living Text of the Gospels. Parker was one of the first serious textualists to challenge my notion of original as the "real" or as the metanarrative legitimating meaning as we read these texts. In general, Parker uses variation within the manuscript tradition of early christian texts that would come to make up what we call the bible today, particularly gospel manuscripts, to suggest that gospels are a tradition, not a law. During an analysis of variations in manuscripts regarding Jesus's comments on marriage and divorce, Parker says, "The quest for a Law in the teachings of Jesus cannot be pursued in the face "of the evidence that, for those early Christians who passed the tradition to "us, there was--no law, but a tradition whose meaning had to be kept alive by "reflection and reinterpretation (Parker, Living Text, 93).

Parker suggests that with the gospel tradition, meaning is practiced, not dictated by or excavated from an original. In his own nod to a preference for genealogy over archaeology, relationship over lineage, Parker suggests,

> The attempt to discern earlier forms of a text , from which those known to us are descended, is an essential task in the critical study of Christian origins. It does not follow that it is also necessary to recover a single original text (Parker, Living Text, 208).

Though I find his idea of the study of Christian origins a bit ironic in the context of his anarchic notion of the biblical tradition, I admire his willingness to question the doxa of the original text while still holding a deep sense of meaning possibilities in the gospel tradition. He helped open a world for me. He altered my habitus by offering a new set of possibilities to shape my dispositions, by begging questions i couldn't even yet imagine.

Taking a very different approach, Tim Beal in *The Rise and Fall of the Bible*, also raises some questions that challenge the cultural notions of bible and book. Driven in part by a curiosity around the continued rise in bible production and sales alongside what seems to be a decline in biblical literacy in America (QUOTE), Beal questions our typical ingrained notions of the relationship between literary production and consumption. He suggests that the meaning and value of the bible in America may have little to do with the accessibility and relevance of the texts inside these books that carry on the ancient manuscript tradition. Instead, it is the cultural iconicity of the bible that generates its value and meaning. Perhaps this cultural iconicity is akin to the reality principle that Baudrillard talks about in Disneyland? People buy bibles not because they actually think they will find some original meaning in these ancient texts that will be relevant to their contemporary life, but because the cultural idea of bible offers a promise that "truth" or "reality" still exist. 

No doubt, Beal is on to something when he suggests that this cultural idea of bible as a locus of singular and univocal truth is bound up in the codex technologies that came to hold in one volume the entire libraries that constituted the various community collections that were called scrolls but came to be know as bible (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location, 2032-46). In so far as this cultural idea of bible prevails, the bible as stable truth or "the real," the cultural value of the bible is married to the the cultural vlaue placed on the codex. Yet, the codex is losing its grip on the reality principle with the advent of e-books, cloud collections, and searchability that gives us new "books" made up of fragments from many sources and with little regard for their location in their "original" narratives. How will the cultural iconicity of the bible fare in this new marketplace?

Like Parker, Beal too problematizes the dominant conception of the bible as a singular book with a stable original. Interestingly, both authors make this argument using the cultural capital valued in the bible context, antiquity, which can easily slide into a sense of recovering an original. Nonetheless, Beal describes the early manuscript tradition of the bible as a collection of texts from many sources and many contexts that "were not the same from copy to copy. There was no beginning and no end to them, no first and last page. They did not have one author or one voice. They were not read in a linear way, but they were read around in. And they grew through interpretation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2046). Beal offers this imagination of the bible as a multivocal, polyvalent and dynamic library to challenge the doxa of the bible as "the literal Word of God and closed book of answers" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2032). Just before this quote, Beal suggests that this cultural imagination of bible as reality principle is already dead, so he goes on to articulate an alternative imagination of the bible as "a space that hosts accidental revelation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location 2060), an infinite cycle of production littered with intrigue and surprise as meaning is made in practice.
