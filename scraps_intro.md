So much modern biblical interpretation has been about finding the original meaning in the text, but such a quest is at best elusive and at worst an illusion.
An anarchic interface provides the opportunity to think of bible and its reading practices entirely differently.
Perhaps we are not thinking about these practices entirely differently.
Instead, maybe just suggesting use practices that fit with an emerging media landscape.
Thinking of bible as an interface rather than simply as a container for content allows us to explore the way emerging technologies can translate and transform enduring traditions of bible reading into the coming media age in ways that transcend the usual media binaries of writer/reader, producer/consumer, form/content, right/wrong.

Why bother? Internet is changing how we imagine books and our relationship with them.
Bible is infinitely tied to the technologies of book, so as technologies transform our notion of book, they will indefinitely change our relationship with bible.
One way to talk about how technologies change our relationship with books, thus bible, is through changes in our relationship to nearness and distance.


Bible has always been bound to book.
The history of bible is so deeply intertwined with the 

I propose that digital media create the possibility to engage bible as an anarchic interface.
I call it an *interface* in order to stress that bible readers are more than just passive consumers of the words they read; they are also makers of meaning.
I describe this interface as *anarchic* because the word’s etymology means both without a beginning and without a reign.
Thus, an anarchic interface is a space of contact where meaning is produced without the reign of an original.


I propose that emerging technologies encourage us to consider bible as an interface that affords proximity through demonstrating the characteristics of high surface area, collaborative capacities, and anarchic tendencies.

@@I need to find some sources that articulate a theory of reading as consumption of content.
I can couple this with the canon conversation as an example of pervasive sense of bible as container of content.

Looking for an alternative to the container model of interface, where the structure of a space dictates the consumptive actions of a user, Johanna Drucker provides a notion of interface as a zone of encounter.
With books, this zone or space is where reader encounters text and something is made in the entanglement of contingencies and possibilities of that particular moment of encounter.
Affordances are a common concept in interface design that will help us explore the ways in which physical characteristics of an interface shape and are shaped by the possible actions of a particular user to construct the possible set of relationships between a user and an interface.
As we consider the design of book interfaces that provide this space of encounter where something is made in the practice of reading, I will advocate for attention to an affordance of anarchy that dethrones the governing role of a singular original without eradicating useful historical relations.
Bible reading communities throughout history have provided some models for this anarchic interface and can provide important guidance and wisdom as we explore emerging media capacities for our relationship with books.^[Add a section here, perhaps, defining a few of the basic terms I use that I will not spend a lot of time defining or will not define more fully later.
Terms such as technology, digital, media/um, bible, book, etc.]

This question of bible as interface emerged for me through an exploration of the material media transition from roll to codex as the dominant book technology in the early centuries of the common era.
We have evidence of one man's experience of this media transition early in antiquity.
The first century Roman poet, Marshall, reflects on encountering his own writings in this new technological form.
Marshall says, "" ().
The codex form of book has been so deeply naturalized as the preeminent form of learning and knowledge for me, that this historical reminder that codex was once a novel and even questionable book technology helps contextualize the current media revolution we are experiencing with the rise of online reading practices.
I have spent my formative academic years in a major media transition from the dominance of print to the proliferation of electronic book interfaces such as Print Document Format (PDF), books on the internet, and the Kindle reader on my iPhone.
This present upheaval in technological mediation of book has made me more attuned to the cultural dynamics that may have been at work in the early centuries of the common era as the codex became more prevalent in literature, law, and religious writings.


My exploration here of bible as a proximate interface and the technological ramifications of bible as book will not endeavor to unpack all of the potential intersections between the emergence of the codex as a predominant medium for christian scriptures and the difficult process of Judeo-Christian differentiation, or lack thereof, during the first four centuries of the common era.^[See Daniel Boyarin's *Borderlines* for an analysis of the demarcation between Jews and Christians in early antiquity.
See many others for the relationship between codex and rise of xianity...] Yet, it will become clear in the conversation partners I have chosen in this project that this question of the difference between Jews and Christians and their relationships with their books is never far from my mind.

Located at the intersection of several discourses, mainly, discussions of the material history of bible as book (grafton, Roberts, skeat, gamble, beal, siker) and the entanglement of emerging technologies and human communication (Plato, Heidegger, Benjamin, turkle, Carr)

In no way do I propose these two terms as opposites and with Drucker I am asking in this project for a greater attention to the materiality of the digital.


** NEED to push from affordance to dispositions because i think that will help in the interface history below, talking about the dispositions afforded by roll, codex and kindle -- maybe focus on a few such as closedness and atomization or something?

With bible as anarchic interface established, I will use N.
Katherine Hayle’s “media specific analysis” to look back at the performance of anarchic interface on the Talmudic page and in illuminated medieval manuscripts.
Then we will analyze a few contemporary bible interfaces in digital media -- Twible, biblegateway.com, and YouVersion’s Bible app -- to evaluate the degree to which they afford anarchy in the practice of reading.
In conclusion, I will beckon us forward by offering the blueprints for an experimental bible app that highlight the challenges and possibilities of anarchic interface design and will offer some encouragement in light of the pervasive anxiety about human relationship and reading practices in today's media environment.


There are two theoretical foundations for this notion of material media translation.
First, Marshall McLuhan offers two insights into the process of emerging media.
He suggests that all new media contain their predecessors, such that there is a continuity of connectedness in the process of change, not stark transitions between media.^[McLuhan, *Understanding Media*, ??.] Writing in multiple vertical columns on a page of a codex is a good example of the continuity of the roll within the newer book technology.
Continuing the codex structure of page turning in the Kindle book interface offers another example of new media continuing the affordances of their ancestors.
Relatedly, McLuhan points out that emerging technologies often involve a change in scale of familiar affordances, rather than introducing entirely new interface capacities.^[McLuhan, *Understanding Media*, ??.] An excellent example of this change in scale is the expansion of the codex's nonlinear access by the Kindle interface.
Here, McLuhan describes a holding together of difference and similarity in the process of media evolution that models a process of translation as articulated by the Italian semiotician, Ubaldo Stecconi, who offers the second theoretical framework for this idea of material media translation.
Stecconi suggests that the three pillars of translation are similarity, difference, and mediation.^[Stecconi, "Five Reasons Why Semiotics is Good For Translation Studies," 23-34.] I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE DIRECTION STECCONI TAKES THIS NOTION OF MEDIATION AS TARGETS SPEAKING FOR ORIGINALS...

## Depicting Palimpsest ##

As I have said before, no media transition is total and all new media continues to embody the forms that came before it.
One of the fascinating historical coincidences (or is it a coincidence?) of early antiquity is the simultaneous rise of the codex as a dominant literary form and the rise of Christianity.
I find it entirely uninteresting to postulate any direct causality in any direction among this relationship, but we have plenty of indicators that books mattered to the early Judeo-Christian milieu and that bible was a hybrid interface for many.
 

## Introducing Affordance ##



 Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant.
This sounds a good bit like an interface.
Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibilities offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface.
^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that occurs between bible and user.

## Affordance and Interface ##

our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] 
 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14).
If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user.
Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces.
The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14).
 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints.
Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural.
Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76).
In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145).
I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained.


Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface.
Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions.
Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*.
Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??).
**More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

In his later expansion of this work, Gibson offers a definition, writing, "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??).^[Gibson, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception* (??, 1979), ??.] 

One potential limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavioral capacities of an organism.
In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance.


From the birth of the codex to the end of the Word as we know it, medium has mattered in the life of bible both in its necessary entanglement with content and in its significant social effects.
In *The Birth of the Codex*, Roberts and Skeat give us a careful look at the storied material history of the technology that has come to dominate our cultural idea of book, the codex (Roberts and Skeat 1970).
Nearly half of the pages of their own codex are devoted to the role of early Christian practices of scripture in the rise of the codex to prominence as a book technology, with this bold claim emerging from their analysis of the manuscript data:

> Even if we give this extended meaning to the term Biblical, the conclusion remains the same, namely that when the Christian Bible first emerges into history the books of which it was composed are always written on papyrus and are always in codex form.
There could not be a greater contrast in format with the non-Christian book of the second century, a contrast all the more remarkable when we recall that Egypt, where all these early Christian texts were found, was the country where the papyrus roll originated and where the status of the roll as the only acceptable format for literature was guaranteed by Alexandria with its dominating position in the world of books (Roberts and Skeat 1970, 42).^[In earlier performances of this dissertation, I embedded images of block quotes from the interface in which I read these quotes, instead of ingesting quotes textually into the word processing format of the rest of the work.
I used the images of quotes to signal the multimedia and intertextual nature of my work.
Allowing the images to interrupt the flow of typed letters can encourage us to engage these other voices in the project as material artifacts that may have different material affordances than those at work in this document.
Both the content offered by these conversation partners and the shape of the interface in which I engaged them matter.]

Acknowledging the difficulty of firmly establishing the ‘biblical’ category and signaling their sensitivity to the narrow provenance of manuscript evidence, all in Egypt, Roberts and Skeat still resoundingly suggest that bible as book begins exclusively as a papyrus codex.
Newer manuscript evidence and different approaches to categories have challenged the ‘always’ of this conclusion.
Yet, the strangeness of this early Christian preference for codex has been reinforced by many more recent explorations of this evidence.^[Examples to come.]

In a book that deeply shaped my own ideas about the adoption of codex technology by Christians, *Books and Readers*,[^4] Harry Gamble focuses more on the readerly use of early Christian texts than on their literary production (Gamble 1995).
Though he may differ in his conclusions from Roberts and Skeat, there is little doubt that bible played a part in the emergence of a new interface.^[Add a sample from Gamble here about emergence of codex in xian use and add a note about other perspectives on role of bible in codex development - Gamble, Hurtado, etc.
Offer p.oxy 1075 and nongbri article as an example.] In my own work on the book as a technology for scripture in antiquity, I found a combination of Gamble, Epp, and O'Donnell provided a compelling picture of the usefulness of the portable notebook becoming associated with Christian leaders, and hence with authority.^[Expand a bit here and cite Epp, O’Donnell, and Wagner.]

```
Add a section in the introduction or in the bible chapter discussing the relationship between bible and scripture and specifically how I am using bible in this project.
See note in chapter 2 from Wimbush.
This would be a brief definition of bible here pointing to a further expansion at the beginning of chapter 3.

## Twilight of an Icon ##

The first chapter of Timothy Beal’s book *The Rise and Fall of the Bible* is titled ‘The End of the Word as we Know It,’ and he feels fine.

> The icon of the Bible, The Book of books, is in the process of deconstruction.
And that, I believe, is a good thing.
It's the end of the Word as we know it, and I feel fine.
The Word as we know it is not very old, as we have already begun to see, and it's a distraction from the Scriptures themselves.
Its end is an occasion to find a fresh approach to the Bible that is truer not only to its content but also to its fascinating history (Beal 2011, location 371).^[See [this music video](https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY) for a sense of the cultural reference embedded in this chapter title.]

The cultural iconicity of 'the Bible' as 'the Book of books' that is undergoing deconstruction is the bible as authoritative, univocal, practical, accessible, comprehensive, and exclusive (Beal 2011, location 121-122).
As Beal also notes, it is not a coincidence that this transformation of the bible as cultural icon coincides with a major cultural translation of the book as a medium.

> Suffice it to say that the end of print culture and the rise of a digital, networked media culture means the end of the book as we know it.
And the end of the book as we know it cannot be divorced from the end of the Word, The Book of books, as we know it (Beal 2011, location 1161).

Just as in antiquity, bible played a role in the emergence of a new book technology, so today, bible as book is entangled in a transition from the reign of print to a proliferation of interfaces in our emerging media age.[^book_as_container]

[^book_as_container]: Maybe add a section on Bible as Container - Perhaps a short explanation here of how container notions of bible are operative in contemporary discourse.
Could we use Tim's code for twitter analysis to demonstrate the common conception of bible as container?

This combination of curiosity and generosity shapes my approach in this project.


In our book technology tradition itself, we have a material metaphor for this process of material media translation, the palimpsest.
A palimpsest is a manuscript that has been written on, erased, and then written on again.
In our analysis of emerging technologies related to bible, each "new" technology writes over an existing technology (or many technologies) with only partial erasure.
Thus, material media translation enacts a kind of palimpsest.
For example, though the codex erases the linear scrolling access of the roll, it retains the multiple vertical columnar structure even though not demanded by the structure of the codex page.
Below is an image of a page from *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus*,^[[*http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8470433r*](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8470433r)] a fifth century manuscript of biblical texts in Greek, washed and written over in the 12th century with Greek translations of the fourth century Syriac writings of Ephrem the Syrian.
This beautiful material enactment of palimpsest, two column miniscule Greek translations of Syriac over single column uncial Greek biblical texts, illustrates marvelously the process of emerging technology building upon existing structures to make something new.

The anxiety that drives Carr's argument in *The Shallows* stems from a loss of the distance provided by the print codex interface.
Internet technologies afford increasing nearness with an always expanding set of possible things to engage, such that users can no longer focus in a sustained manner on a singular, linear text.
On the contrary, a codex affords a more singular nearness in interface, with covers to mark what is in and what is out typically with some measure of linear progression from beginning to end.
In Carr's imagination, the codex provides a focused and contained nearness that creates a distance from all other things, which in turns facilitates a deep thinking that is more valuable than the shallowness afforded by the internet.
Long durations of time and the concept of depth are also forms of distance and Carr finds these affordances of distance in the codex interface.

## Nothing New ##

In his long historical run up to the current media situation of the internet, Carr reminds readers that the anxiety around changes in technology and its impact on the human brain are not at all new.
In the 4th century before the common era, as the technology of an alphabet began to take root, writing emerged as a new technology for communication and learning.
Following the lead of Walter Ong's analysis of Plato is his work *Orality and Literacy*, Carr points to what seems to be a negative view of writing in *Phaedrus* and more positive views on literacy in *The Republic*.[^27] Ong and Carr reference the well trodden passage from *Phaedrus* that communicates a worry about the impact of writing on memory, since writing affords easy reference to a content set outside the memory of an individual.[^28] Undoubtedly, these reflections on an entirely different time period of major technological transition provide a helpful reminder that these anxieties about emerging technologies are not a new phenomenon.
Further reflections on this anxious passage from *Phaedrus* in conversation with other mentions of writing in the Platonic corpus point less to a concern about the difference between internal and external memory technologies and more toward a worry about the impact of writing on dynamic dialog.
Lane Wilkinson's analysis of the views on writing in *Phaedrus*[^29] points toward a passage shortly following the anxious bit about memory, where Socrates says to Phaedrus,

> I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence.
And the same may be said of speeches.
You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer.
And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves.[^30]

If, as Wilkinson suggests, the primary value operative for Plato is dialog, then writing provided an interface in antiquity that afforded a new kind of nearness to words and ideas that threatened the participation in dialog.
Susan Dobra points to a short passage in the "Seventh Letter" that highlights this again, where Plato says, "that is why no intelligent man will ever dare to commit his thoughts to words, still less to words that cannot be changed, as is the case with what is expressed in written characters."[^31] As both Wilkinson and Dobra highlight so nicely, it is the fixicity of written text that affords an irresponsible nearness for the reader in exchange for the dynamics of dialog.
This concern about the impact of increasing nearness provided by new technologies, particularly the effects it might have on the ambiguity and dynamics of dialog sound similar to Drucker's questioning of the mechanistic determinism of contemporary interface theories operative in the software world.
In a sense, both Plato and Drucker are advocating for a nearness of the subject over the nearness of content.


## Dealing with Distance ##

In a much nearer time period, Martin Heidegger delivered a set of lectures just after the second world war addressing the changes in nearness and distance brought about by the rise of mechanical technologies.[^32] These lectures, know as the Bremen lectures, occurred in Bremen in 1949 as Heidegger's first public address after the war ended.
He begins the lecture series with a clear statement of the issue he is confronting, saying, "All distances in time and space are shrinking."[^33] The rest of the lecture series explores the changing relationship between distance and nearness with the rise of modern technologies such as airplanes, radio, film, and television.[^34] Heidegger frames his concern in terms of distance not nearness, because he will redefine nearness as something exceeding the spatial and relational closeness we have been exploring thus far.
Distance, for Heidegger remains spatial or relational, while nearness comes to signify an intimate encounter related to truth, which experiences the "actuality" of a thing, and technology does not offer this even as it collapses the distance of space and time.[^35] In a subtle twist of the more well known title of the expanded version of lecture two, "The Question Concerning Technology," the concern in these questions about technology is what happens to the possibility of nearness as difference when technologies afford a kind of distancelessness?[^36] Heidegger will go on to articulate the essence of technology as the process that renders all being, humans and nature included, as distanceless without nearness.[^37] He begins the second lecture saying, "All mastery of distances brings no nearness at all."[^38] Though the language is a bit different, the distancelessness that has Heidegger bothered is a historically located version of the anxiety we saw about the affordance of nearness in Plato, Turkle, and Carr.
   

Also interested in the impact of these changes in scale of nearness and distance brought on by technologies, another thinker, Roger Silverstone, more recently has taken up this question about distance in relation to internet technologies and cyberspace.
Advocating for what he calls "proper distance" as a framework for the possibility of ethics in internet communication technologies, Silverstone argues for the necessity to resist the tendency toward the distancelessness and overnearness possible in emerging technologies as highlighted by Heidegger's anxieties we have just seen.[^39] Silverstone offers two important directives in our consideration of nearness and distance in interface.
First, challenging the common exhuberance about the possibilities for connection and communication provided by the internet as a kind of nearness, Silverstone champions the value of distance as irreducible difference or even the insistent interruption of connection afforded by internet communication technologies.[^40] Second, Silverstone signals the usefulness of Emmanuel Levinas's concept of proximity as a way to consider the difficult tension of contact and separation necessary to afford ethical human relationship in electronically mediated spaces.[^41] Taking Silverstone's lead in his helpful corrective to the focus simply on nearness in emerging technologies, I too find Levinasian proximity a valuable framework for exploring even human-machine interface as a constant negotiation of nearness and distance in what can be imagined as contact without grasp.

??Siker takes these anxieties explicitly to bible.
