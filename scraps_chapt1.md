Interface, like any other component of computational Systems, is an artifact of complex processes and protocols, a Zone in which our behaviors and actions take place. Interface is what we read and how we read combined through engagement. Interface is a provocation to cognitive experience.[^27]


As she looks to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), social networking, and visualization for hints of new possibilities, we may even look back into print technologies (e.g. Talmudic page) for some suggestions toward interface design that might afford a bible textual apparatus that is "constellationary, distributed, and multi-faceted." 

A few basic examples of interface from the computing world will help illustrate what I mean by interface. There are several types of interfaces we use to relate to computers. NOT SURE WHAT LEVEL OF EXAMPLES TO GIVE HERE to best illustrate the breadth of interface operative in computing. Maybe a touchscreen, a library discovery interface, and an operating system? 

After looking closely at these definitions of interface and exploring a few basic examples from the computing world, I propose a definition of interface as "a space that facilitate relationship without eradicating difference." In the definition itself, we see the operations of interface in the "and." In this coordinating conjunction, we see a space and process of holding the noun and verb functions of the word "interface" in relationship, without needing to reduce interface to one or the other. If a space facilitates relationship that does not maintain the difference brought to the relationship by the participants, then, this space is not interface.  


particularly a space that is something other than a space 'between,' points toward a second way of theorizing interface through Edward Soja's notion of thirding. 

If interface is a product of relations, not simply the material affordances of a technology, then interface is a space and a process, not simply a thing (Drucker 2011, 3). With this notion of interface as space and process, we need a way to talk about the participants in this spatial process. 

In order to better understand this productive process of reading, we will look toward interface theory. Often, we associate interface with digital technologies. Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) have become major areas of study and discourse in the world of software design.^[Give some examples.] If we look at the basic uses of '[interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=interface+definition)' in the English language, we can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as the prevalent use in the computing arena.^[Google Search for 'interface definitionâ€™ on August 1, 2015.] When I take up the language of interface, I do not want to limit our conversation to digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. Interface offers a broader category for spaces of encounter that include many forms of media and mediation. In order to more clearly articulate the rich possibilities of interface, I will offer three related ways to think of interface theoretically - interface as zone of encounter, interface as thirdspace, and interface as process.
 

A few examples will help highlight this specific use of the term in the technological realm. A web page is often thought of as an interface of the computing variety.  and an API...

## Two cultural metaphors for interface ##

Before we move on to explore interface as both space and process through Johanna Drucker's suggestion of interface as zone of encounter, I'd like to mention two other important examples of interface that have shaped my thinking significantly: the relationship between new media object and cultural interface in Lev Manovich and S. Brent Plate's discussion of *The Skin of Religion*.^[I'd like to highlight that my attraction to interface as a concept emerged out of conversations I had about water as a surface with Timothy Beal at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014. In Beal's lectures at NSTS 2014, he offered the idea of bible as media and we discussed the possibility of water as a metaphor for this phenomenon. It was the material and theoretical connotations of water as sur-face, both in the biological realm and in Hebrew scriptures that pushed me to consider the possibility of bible as interface.]

## Reading as Material Production ##

I will focus primarily on the readerly uses of bible, these relationships between user and interface, which produce the material encounters that constitute the reading process.  


```
Maybe add a section here on different notions of emergence or wait and do this down in the probability section

Actually, I might throw out all of this and put a different theory of emergence in its place. 
```

## Interface as Process ##

With Piotr Blumczynski's new book *Ubiquitous Translation*[^37] and the focus on the WHAT and HOW, I feel like I could link the WHAT and HOW of reading in Drucker to the WHAT and HOW of translation and suggest that interface is a kind of translational event. In a sense then, we have at least two kinds of translations going on with bible, a material media translation of book from print codex to mobile phone as well as the translational act that is interface.

If we look back to the computing definition of interface we began with earlier in this chapter, the idea of translation emerged even there. As Blumczynski suggests, translation is ubiquitous and I would argue that interface is a translational act. So, there are two reasons I bring in Piotr's work here. First, highlight the value of translation as a paradigm for the notion of interface we are working with here. Second, 

Perhaps I can argue that interface is place (lived space) or stick with the going definition of interface as space and extend the definition of space to include process/thirding? Space is a social process of social construction. But none of this highlights the materiality of the digital/virtual. What I really want to say is that interface is material and it is process. Interface is a material process 

As I noted when we first encountered a computing definition of interface, the function of interface in computing has taken on a decidedly translational role. In the world of human computer interaction (HCI), it is as if there are two language groups, machine and human, and they need a mediator to enable communication between them. In a simplistic sense then, interface becomes the translator between humans and machines. Even better, interface is the space and process of translation that facilitates the relationship between humans and machines without minimizing the differences between them. Rather than reduce one participant, human or machine, to the other or make both participants become something new that is the same, interface enables a relationality that maintains the difference between participants.

As I noted above, even the early boundary notions of interface demand both difference and connection, but with the introduction of communication, we have moved now into the realm of exchange.^[exchange]

^[exchange]: Any close study of material science would demonstrate that exchange has always been a part of interface, even in the scientific realm. We often talk about stable states of a system or the interaction of systems such that there is a clean and distinct boundary between the surface of water and air. This boundary that constitutes interface is actually a dynamic equilibrium of exchange, such that the *process* of exchange constructs the space that is the boundary. Communication as exchange has the potential to bring language into our discussion of interface which could lead down several paths toward linguistics, semantics, semiotics, machine language, artificial intelligence, and many more. All of these areas of study matter significantly to our explorations of interface, book, bible, human, etc., and it has always been difficult to use language to talk about language without language already determining the limits of the discussion. I will look forward to engaging other scholars who will take up the particular question of language and interface down the road, but for now, I will direct our attention toward one aspect of communication that seems critical for interface and that is translation.

### Future of Academic Book ###

In her essay, Drucker makes some hints toward what we might find in emerging scholarly interpretive reading interfaces. There is a movement afoot that is gently and gradually trying to take seriously this call to imagine the academic book as interface in our emerging media landscape. The Future of the Academic Book project began as a collaborative project...Though I have had a hard time seeing how the FOAB project has interrupted the established dispositions of print and codex to allow the possibilities of emerging technologies, the community of discourse that has fostered this movement has most definitely demonstrated a desire for and commitment to a constructivist and collaborative process. Their patience and respect for tradition could create the necessary space for translation of the deeply ingrained material sensibilities embedded in the culture of the academic book. I hope to incorporate the innovative spirit and the patient wisdom of both Drucker and the FOAB project as we push toward imagining bible as interface.

**WILL EXPAND ON THIS EXAMPLE...**

[//]: something about the relationship between semantic and consumptive and performative and production. need to indicate that interface seems to hold together aspects of iconic and performative dimensions, but decidedly dethroning the semantic.  

--Similarly, bible readers are not just interpreters, they are users that produce bible through their relationship with the material technologies of their scriptures. Plate goes even further in "The Skin of Religion" suggesting that religion is grounded in a "skinscape" which operates as a space of encounter between human senses and the objects of the physical world. Here, Plate is participating in  Here, I am extending Plate's notion of skinscape in the study of religion to an emphasis on the materiality of bible as interface, a space of encounter that entangles user and platform in an emergent process of producing bible.

My suggestion that we think of bible as an interface has two main aims. First, bible as interface can challenge ideas and practices that reduce bible to simply a container of content to be consumed and can guide our imagination of bible in a time of major media transition. Second, an interface that resists our recourse to an original text or singular governing principle in the act of reading can help focus us on the vast productive potentialities of this interface even as it is translated into media technologies we have yet to imagine. This first chapter will focus on the first of these aims by advocating for a concept^[Might add a note here from Piotr about the preference for concept over definition.] of interface as a space and a process that facilitate relationship without eradicating difference. 

Taking both the general definition and the computing definition together, we get something like interface enables interface. This computer interface is a thing that helps create the space for meeting and interacting between user and machine or machine and machine, a translation layer of sorts.

Interface is a space that fosters a process of interaction that foregrounds the values of difference and relationality. 

This concept of interface as event, which includes both the noun and verb characteristics of interface, resonates with the theory of space operative in Edward Soja's idea of thirdspace and the corresponding process of inquiry he calls thirding. 

## Interface as Space ##

The spatiality of Drucker's concept of interface is highlighted in her use of graphical reading practices and frame analysis to build her theory of interface as zone of encounter (Drucker 2011, 3-8). If, as Drucker suggests, interface is a space of encounter, but something more than simply a space between, then we can imagine resonances between Drucker's interface theory and Edward Soja's theory of space. Soja begins his introduction to *Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places* with a focus on participatory construction of space, saying, 

> We are becoming increasingly aware that we are, and always have been, intrinsically spatial beings, active participants in the social construction of our embracing spatialities. Perhaps more than ever before, a strategic awareness of this collectively created spatiality and its social consequences has become a vital part of making both theoretical and practical sense of our contemporary lifeworlds at all scales, from the most intimate to the most global (Soja 1996, 1).

This idea that we are "active participants in the social construction" of space echoes Drucker's focus on a constructivist subjectivity in her theory of interface. For both Soja and Drucker it is not simply that we together construct space but also that spaces construct us as we construct spaces. Soja's mention of "social consequences" here hearkens to Marshall McLuhan's famous adage that "the medium is the message." Though often misunderstood as reductionist or absolutist, McLuhan is simply suggesting that the message of any medium is its social effect, not the simply the content it contains (McLuhan 1964, 8).^[Perhaps it would have been more helpful to hold both directions of this famous apposition together such that medium is message and message is medium.] In the tradition of McLuhan, both Soja and Drucker emphasize that our materiality, which can be called media or can be called spatiality, has a significant impact on our sociality, even in digital environments. 

Combining Henri Lefebvre's "lived space" and Jorge Luis Borges's "Aleph", Soja articulates Thirdspace as a radical simultaneity where all spaces and all binaries come together (Soja 1996, 56-57). As Jacob Kinnard suggests in his preface to *Spaces in Motion*, Soja's notion of Thirdspace is "complex, slippery, and often frustrating" (Kinnard 2014, xv), so I will only attempt to draw the necessary connections between the possibilities of Thirdspace and my reflections on interface. Soja suggests that his notion of Thirdspace is closest to the third moment in Lefebvre's trialectic of social space, "lived space" (Soja 1996a, 68).^[Soja provides a discussion of Lefebvre's multiple names for this third moment in his trialectic as both "spaces of representation" and "lived space," but even at the cost of oversimplification, perhaps inevitable when trying to write or talk about these things, I will only use "lived space" (Soja 1996, 65).] This lived space of Lefebvre's is both separate from and the complex composite of the spatial practices (perceived space) and the conceptions of space (conceived space) that make up the other components of social spatiality (Soja 1996, 67-68). What is import for our theory of interface here is that space is a noun and a verb. Space in Soja's model is always a complex interaction among the materiality of spaces, our ideas of spaces, and the process of making meaning in these spaces, without the need to reduce space to any one of these constituent parts.^[I am beginning to wonder if the concept of place from thinkers like Cresswell and others might offer another useful metaphor for imagining interface. If place is space made meaningful, is this not what interface is all about? The reason I have stayed with space in this analysis is to foreground the materiality of this process of constructing all parties involved in interface.] Space as a system of interaction without reduction of difference sounds a great deal like interface as event in Drucker. This material and processual notion of space from Soja, provides a richer concept of interface as a *space* of relationship that supports difference.

An important part of Thirdspace that further supports our understanding of interface as space that enables difference is the methodology that undergirds even the articulation of Soja's model. The critical methodology at work in his notion of Thirdspace, Soja calls "Thirding-as-Othering," which is the mechanism by which his (and Lefebvre's) spatial analysis resists reduction to binarisms or dichotomies such as real/virtual, subject/object, or user/interface (Soja 1996, 60-61). As with the rest of his ideas in *Thirdspace*, Soja "approximates" this methodology of thirding-as-othering from Lefebvre's anti-reductionist approach described by the phrase "there is always an-Other."^[Add Fench in a footnote.] Soja's thirding provides a focus on space not as a simple combination of two forces, such as the social and the historical, but rather as a methodology that always attends to a third term that can emerge in the process of encounter. Soja writes, 

> Thirding introduces a critical 'other-than' choice that speaks and critiques through
its otherness. That is to say, it does not derive simply from an additive combination of its binary antecedents but rather from a disordering, deconstruction, and tentative reconstitution of their presumed totalization producing an open alternative that is both similar and strikingly different (Soja 1996, 61).

For example, a print book as a platform presents a set of constraints and possibilities on a reading event as does a particular reader sitting in an arm chair on a snowy Sunday afternoon. In this process of interface, thirding suggests that the combinatorial set of possibilities offered by the intersection of platform and user do not *determine* the productive potential of this interface. There is always an other possibility that can emerge in the process of encounter that can surprise or interrupt our expecations. It is this interruptive emergence and its insistence on resisting a closed system that thirding offers our theory of interface. Drucker's notion of interface as event or zone of encounter, with its constructivist approach, already challenges the mechanistic and determinative binaries of user and technological platform, encouraging a more spatial, material, and constructed notion of both media and the subject. Soja's Thirding-as-Othering, which practices an infinite preference for an alternative when faced with a binary choice, adds the property of emergence to our theory of interface (Soja 1996b, 1421). This explicit and intentional methodology of surfacing multiplicity and the possibility for unexpected newness when faced with a binary may not yet guide interface design or theory like it does Soja's cultural critique. Yet, Soja's Thirding-as-Othering provides us a disposition toward emergence, possibilities that arise in the process of interface that challenge established categories and resist closed analysis without a need to eradicate these categories. Interface as space of the thirding kind pushes the multiplicity Drucker encourages in her framing of interface toward a property of emergence in interface that will always overflow our analysis.
