Interface, like any other component of computational Systems, is an artifact of complex processes and protocols, a Zone in which our behaviors and actions take place. Interface is what we read and how we read combined through engagement. Interface is a provocation to cognitive experience.[^27]


As she looks to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), social networking, and visualization for hints of new possibilities, we may even look back into print technologies (e.g. Talmudic page) for some suggestions toward interface design that might afford a bible textual apparatus that is "constellationary, distributed, and multi-faceted." 

A few basic examples of interface from the computing world will help illustrate what I mean by interface. There are several types of interfaces we use to relate to computers. NOT SURE WHAT LEVEL OF EXAMPLES TO GIVE HERE to best illustrate the breadth of interface operative in computing. Maybe a touchscreen, a library discovery interface, and an operating system? 

After looking closely at these definitions of interface and exploring a few basic examples from the computing world, I propose a definition of interface as "a space that facilitate relationship without eradicating difference." In the definition itself, we see the operations of interface in the "and." In this coordinating conjunction, we see a space and process of holding the noun and verb functions of the word "interface" in relationship, without needing to reduce interface to one or the other. If a space facilitates relationship that does not maintain the difference brought to the relationship by the participants, then, this space is not interface.  


particularly a space that is something other than a space 'between,' points toward a second way of theorizing interface through Edward Soja's notion of thirding. 

If interface is a product of relations, not simply the material affordances of a technology, then interface is a space and a process, not simply a thing (Drucker 2011, 3). With this notion of interface as space and process, we need a way to talk about the participants in this spatial process. 

In order to better understand this productive process of reading, we will look toward interface theory. Often, we associate interface with digital technologies. Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) have become major areas of study and discourse in the world of software design.^[Give some examples.] If we look at the basic uses of '[interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=interface+definition)' in the English language, we can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as the prevalent use in the computing arena.^[Google Search for 'interface definition’ on August 1, 2015.] When I take up the language of interface, I do not want to limit our conversation to digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. Interface offers a broader category for spaces of encounter that include many forms of media and mediation. In order to more clearly articulate the rich possibilities of interface, I will offer three related ways to think of interface theoretically - interface as zone of encounter, interface as thirdspace, and interface as process.
 

A few examples will help highlight this specific use of the term in the technological realm. A web page is often thought of as an interface of the computing variety.  and an API...

## Two cultural metaphors for interface ##

Before we move on to explore interface as both space and process through Johanna Drucker's suggestion of interface as zone of encounter, I'd like to mention two other important examples of interface that have shaped my thinking significantly: the relationship between new media object and cultural interface in Lev Manovich and S. Brent Plate's discussion of *The Skin of Religion*.^[I'd like to highlight that my attraction to interface as a concept emerged out of conversations I had about water as a surface with Timothy Beal at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014. In Beal's lectures at NSTS 2014, he offered the idea of bible as media and we discussed the possibility of water as a metaphor for this phenomenon. It was the material and theoretical connotations of water as sur-face, both in the biological realm and in Hebrew scriptures that pushed me to consider the possibility of bible as interface.]

## Reading as Material Production ##

I will focus primarily on the readerly uses of bible, these relationships between user and interface, which produce the material encounters that constitute the reading process.

Maybe add a section here on different notions of emergence or wait and do this down in the probability section

Actually, I might throw out all of this and put a different theory of emergence in its place.

## Interface as Process ##

With Piotr Blumczynski's new book *Ubiquitous Translation*[^37] and the focus on the WHAT and HOW, I feel like I could link the WHAT and HOW of reading in Drucker to the WHAT and HOW of translation and suggest that interface is a kind of translational event. In a sense then, we have at least two kinds of translations going on with bible, a material media translation of book from print codex to mobile phone as well as the translational act that is interface.

If we look back to the computing definition of interface we began with earlier in this chapter, the idea of translation emerged even there. As Blumczynski suggests, translation is ubiquitous and I would argue that interface is a translational act. So, there are two reasons I bring in Piotr's work here. First, highlight the value of translation as a paradigm for the notion of interface we are working with here. Second, 

Perhaps I can argue that interface is place (lived space) or stick with the going definition of interface as space and extend the definition of space to include process/thirding? Space is a social process of social construction. But none of this highlights the materiality of the digital/virtual. What I really want to say is that interface is material and it is process. Interface is a material process 

As I noted when we first encountered a computing definition of interface, the function of interface in computing has taken on a decidedly translational role. In the world of human computer interaction (HCI), it is as if there are two language groups, machine and human, and they need a mediator to enable communication between them. In a simplistic sense then, interface becomes the translator between humans and machines. Even better, interface is the space and process of translation that facilitates the relationship between humans and machines without minimizing the differences between them. Rather than reduce one participant, human or machine, to the other or make both participants become something new that is the same, interface enables a relationality that maintains the difference between participants.

As I noted above, even the early boundary notions of interface demand both difference and connection, but with the introduction of communication, we have moved now into the realm of exchange.^[exchange]

^[exchange]: Any close study of material science would demonstrate that exchange has always been a part of interface, even in the scientific realm. We often talk about stable states of a system or the interaction of systems such that there is a clean and distinct boundary between the surface of water and air. This boundary that constitutes interface is actually a dynamic equilibrium of exchange, such that the *process* of exchange constructs the space that is the boundary. Communication as exchange has the potential to bring language into our discussion of interface which could lead down several paths toward linguistics, semantics, semiotics, machine language, artificial intelligence, and many more. All of these areas of study matter significantly to our explorations of interface, book, bible, human, etc., and it has always been difficult to use language to talk about language without language already determining the limits of the discussion. I will look forward to engaging other scholars who will take up the particular question of language and interface down the road, but for now, I will direct our attention toward one aspect of communication that seems critical for interface and that is translation.

### Future of Academic Book ###

In her essay, Drucker makes some hints toward what we might find in emerging scholarly interpretive reading interfaces. There is a movement afoot that is gently and gradually trying to take seriously this call to imagine the academic book as interface in our emerging media landscape. The Future of the Academic Book project began as a collaborative project...Though I have had a hard time seeing how the FOAB project has interrupted the established dispositions of print and codex to allow the possibilities of emerging technologies, the community of discourse that has fostered this movement has most definitely demonstrated a desire for and commitment to a constructivist and collaborative process. Their patience and respect for tradition could create the necessary space for translation of the deeply ingrained material sensibilities embedded in the culture of the academic book. I hope to incorporate the innovative spirit and the patient wisdom of both Drucker and the FOAB project as we push toward imagining bible as interface.
